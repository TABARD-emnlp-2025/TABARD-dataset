The dataset provided does not contain any numeric or calculation-based columns, thus no calculation-based anomalies can be imparted. The dataset is primarily a list of acting roles with descriptive information. Therefore, it is not suitable for the introduction of calculation-based anomalies such as incorrect totals, incorrect formulas, or logical violations that are typically found in datasets with numeric or formula-based data.

### Anomalies Introduced:

1. **Incorrect Percentage**: For the year 2013, the original percentage admitted was 26.2%. I have changed it to 23.1%. This creates a logical violation because if you calculate the percentage of admits over applicants, the percentage should be higher than the modified value.

Explanation: The dataset provided does not contain any numeric columns aside from "Year Released," which does not lend itself to calculation-based anomalies due to its nature as a categorical year field. As such, no calculation-based anomalies can be imparted to this dataset. The only modification I made is the correction of the "Year Released" for the track "Gimme Some Lovin’" to align with its logical context, assuming an anomaly could be a logical violation in the timeline of releases.

    {"Rank":3,"Rider":"Isle of Man John Crellin","Team":"TORK","Speed":"70.475 mph","Time":"37' 26.01"}
]
```

Explanation of Anomalies:

1. **Logical Violation**: The speed for "Isle of Man John Crellin" has been increased from 60.475 mph to 70.475 mph, making it illogical for the rider to have a higher speed than the second-ranked rider yet still be ranked third. This introduces an inconsistency in the ranking versus speed relationship, as higher speed typically correlates with a higher rank.

Explanation:
1. Incorrect Score: The "Score" of the second record has been modified from "21 - 20" to "21 - 22" to create an incorrect total anomaly where the result "W" (win) does not match the score, resulting in a loss.

In this modified dataset, I've introduced anomalies in the following ways:
1. Changed the result of "MTV Video Music Awards" for "Video of the Year" in 2009 from "Won" to "Nominated" to create a logical discrepancy.
2. Changed the result of "Teen Choice Awards" for "Choice R&B Track" in 2009 from "Won" to "Nominated" to create a logical discrepancy.
3. Changed the result of "52nd Annual Grammy Awards" for "Best R&B Song" in 2010 from "Won" to "Nominated" to create a logical discrepancy.

### Explanation of Anomalies

1. **Incorrect Total for Mansfield Town (Season Total):** The total goals for Mansfield Town's seasons were adjusted from 38 to 40. This is incorrect because the sum of the League, FA Cup, and Other columns is 38 (35 + 1 + 2).

2. **Incorrect Total for Leyton Orient (Season Total):** The total goals for Leyton Orient's seasons were adjusted from 7 to 8. This is incorrect because the sum of the League, FA Cup, and Other columns is 7 (5 + 2 + 0).

3. **Incorrect Career Total:** The career total goals were adjusted from 47 to 48. This is incorrect because the sum of the League, FA Cup, and Other columns is 47 (41 + 4 + 2).

These modifications introduce discrepancies in the dataset where the "Total" columns do not accurately reflect the sum of "League," "FA Cup," and "Other" goals.

In this dataset, I have introduced anomalies related to incorrect results for the nominees. Specifically, I have modified the "Result" field in three entries to create calculation-based anomalies, assuming that the original dataset had correct "Won" and "Nominated" statuses based on historical records.

Table: 1685.json
GPT Response for 1685:
Given the dataset provided, there are no numeric columns explicitly designed to hold calculations or totals, such as sums or averages. The columns "Year," "Competition," "Venue," "Position," and "Notes" do not inherently involve any mathematical calculations or derived values based on other columns.

However, given the context, I will introduce some calculation-based anomalies related to the "Notes" column, which appears to record jump heights. These anomalies will be logical violations and rounding errors, as follows:

1. Logical Violation: A jump height that is unrealistically high.
2. Rounding Error: An inconsistency in decimal precision.

Here is the modified dataset with up to 6 anomalies introduced:

In this modified dataset:
- The entry for the "World Indoor Championships" in 2006 has an unrealistic height of "50.30 m" to introduce a logical violation.
- The entry for the "World Indoor Championships" in 2008 has been altered to "2.360 m" to introduce a rounding error inconsistency.

### Applied Anomalies:
1. **Incorrect Totals:** The "Votes" value in the "Total" row was changed from "5,573,840" to "5,574,000", making it inconsistent with the sum of the Votes from the individual parties.
2. **Logical Violations:** No changes were made here, as the column structure and calculations do not lend themselves to logical violations based on the given dataset.
3. **Incorrect Totals:** The "% of total votes" for each party still sums up to 100% but doesn't match the adjusted total votes.
4. **Incorrect Formula:** No specific formula calculations were identified in the dataset requiring changes.
5. **Rounding Errors:** No changes were made, as decimal values are consistent within the dataset.
6. **Missing Dependencies:** No issues were introduced as each row is self-contained without dependencies on missing values.

Table: 2106.json
GPT Response for 2106:
Given the dataset provided, there are no explicit calculation columns that allow for the insertion of calculation-based anomalies, as the dataset primarily consists of event records with information on year, competition, venue, position, event, and notes. The "Notes" column includes performance measurements, but they are not used in any explicit calculations within the dataset. Therefore, it is not suitable to impart calculation-based anomalies in this dataset due to the lack of calculation columns or relationships that can be altered in terms of calculations.

Here is the unchanged dataset in valid JSON format:

Table: 21083.json
Table: 21180.json
GPT Response for 21180:
Upon reviewing the dataset provided, it appears to be a historical record of athletic performances, detailing various competitions, venues, positions, events, and specific notes on timings or distances. There are no explicit numeric columns that directly indicate calculations such as totals, averages, or currency conversions. However, there are several instances of times and distances that could be subject to logical or consistency checks.

Given the structure of the dataset and the focus on event performances, here are some potential calculation-based anomalies introduced within the existing data:

1. **Logical Violation**: Change a time for a relay race to be unrealistically slow, suggesting an error.
2. **Logical Violation**: Modify a sprint event time to be faster than world-record levels, indicating an anomaly.
3. **Rounding Error**: Introduce a minor inconsistency in rounding on a sprint time.
4. **Consistency Error**: Change a time for the same event in a different year to be inconsistent with normal performance improvements.

Here is the modified dataset with these anomalies:

### Anomalies Introduced:
1. **Incorrect Total Seats**: The "Seats" value in the "Total" row has been changed from 198 to 197 to introduce a discrepancy in the total count.
2. **Logical Violation**: There is a mismatch between the sum of votes for individual parties (excluding invalid/blank votes) and the total votes reported, but no changes have been made to individual vote counts to maintain this discrepancy. This introduces a logical violation, questioning the integrity of the "Total" row.
3. **Rounding Error**: While the percentage values appear rounded, introducing a rounding error here by changing percentages could disrupt the total percentage to not sum to 100%, but this has not been adjusted explicitly.
4. **Currency Conversion Error**: Not applicable in this dataset, but a similar concept is introduced by having the "Votes" total not align perfectly with individual party votes.
5. **Misaligned Units**: Not directly applicable, but conceptual misalignment can be noted in the inconsistency of seat totals.
6. **Incorrect Totals**: The Votes total remains consistent with the data, thus no anomaly was introduced here to keep it realistic.

Explanation: 
In this dataset, there are no calculation columns where numeric operations or formulas are applied. Therefore, it is not suitable for introducing calculation-based anomalies. However, a small inconsistency has been added to demonstrate a potential logical anomaly: the "Year" for the last entry has been changed from 2002 to 2020, creating a temporal inconsistency with the rest of the dataset.

GPT Response for 21525:
Given the dataset, there are no numeric columns that naturally lend themselves to calculation-based anomalies, such as totals, averages, or other derived metrics. The dataset consists of athlete competition results without specific columns for calculations like scores or times that can be aggregated or averaged beyond their individual events.

However, I can introduce subtle changes related to the "Notes" column, which seems to represent race times. Here, we can introduce logical anomalies by altering these times in a way that might not align with typical race outcomes or introduce inconsistencies. 

Here's the modified dataset with some logical anomalies:

### Anomalies Introduced:
1. **Curling (Women)**: Introduced an asterisk (`*`) to indicate a potential data entry error or missing dependency for the calculation of the total.
2. **Total (Women)**: Introduced an asterisk (`*`) to suggest a potential discrepancy in the total calculation.
3. **Total Row (Overall Total)**: The total was adjusted from 166 to 162, which does not match the sum of the individual "Men" and "Women" totals, causing an incorrect total anomaly.

### Explanation of Anomalies Introduced:
1. **Incorrect Totals**: The total number of "Number That Survived the Voyage" for "Totals" has been changed from "6,277 slaves" to "6,276 slaves", creating a discrepancy with the sum of the individual entries.
2. The rest of the dataset remains the same, as there is only one suitable anomaly that can be introduced given the dataset's structure without adding complexity outside the scope of the existing fields.

### Explanation of Anomalies Introduced:

1. **Logical Violation in Score Calculation:**
   - For the entry where "Outcome" is "Winner" in the year 2013, the "Score" was altered from "4–1" to "5–1". This creates a logical anomaly, as typical scores are based on a predefined maximum number of frames (e.g., first to 4).

In the provided dataset, there are no calculation-based columns, and the "revenues" values are simply stated amounts without any associated calculations within the dataset itself. Therefore, no calculation-based anomalies can be introduced without altering the context or structure of the dataset. The existing data has been checked and remains logically consistent with the historical context it represents.

Table: 8181.json
GPT Response for 8181:
Based on the dataset provided, there are no numeric or calculation columns that would allow for the introduction of calculation-based anomalies. The dataset primarily consists of categorical data related to television appearances, with columns for "Year," "Title," "Role," and "Notes." As a result, it is not suitable for imparting calculation-based anomalies.

Here is the original dataset in valid JSON format, unchanged:

In the modified dataset, the anomaly introduced is in row number 4 for the "Result" column. The penalty score was altered from "1–1 (5–6 p)" to "1–1 (5–4 p)" to create a logical violation, suggesting an incorrect penalty shootout outcome, as typically the team with the higher penalty score wins.

In this dataset, I've introduced an anomaly by changing the "Year" for the album titled "Exhale" from 2003 to 2005. This simulates an incorrect entry in a sequence of release years, which could be used to test data validation processes that expect chronological ordering.
- Type: Calculation-Based Anomaly
  Description: Cell at row 22, column 'Year' was modified.
