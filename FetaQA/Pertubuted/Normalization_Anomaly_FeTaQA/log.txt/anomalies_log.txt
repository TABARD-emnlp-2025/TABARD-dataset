Changes and Anomalies Introduced:

1. **Repeating Groups (1NF Violation):** In the "Other" and "FA Cup" columns, added multiple values in a single cell (e.g., "1,2" in the "Other" column for the 1882–83 season and "3,2" in the "FA Cup" column for the 1886–87 season).

2. **Denormalization:** Changed the "Total" for the 1883–84 season to 10, which does not accurately reflect the sum of individual goals, violating the principle of storing derived values.

3. **Denormalization:** Changed the "Total" for the 1884–85 season to 23, which does not match the sum of individual goals, introducing inconsistency in computed totals.

4. **Repeating Groups (1NF Violation):** Added multiple values in the "Other" column for the 1888–89 season ("3,1"), further breaking the atomicity rule.

These modifications introduce various normalization anomalies into the dataset, creating inconsistencies and redundancies.

```

In this modified dataset, I've introduced two normalization anomalies:

1. **Repeating Groups (1NF Violation):** For the `League` column in the `Stoke` and `Doncaster Rovers` Total rows, I've introduced multiple values within a single cell to violate the First Normal Form (1NF), which requires atomic values. This creates a repeating group within a single column.

2. **Denormalization (Derived Values):** The `Total` column now holds a direct sum of the `League` values that include non-atomic data, as seen in the `Doncaster Rovers` Total row. This can lead to inconsistencies if the `League` column values are not correctly interpreted as individual integers.

**Explanation of Anomalies Introduced:**

1. **Anomaly 1 (Partial Dependency):** The "Newcastle United" total is incorrectly modified to reflect a sum that depends only on a subset of its seasons, violating 2NF.
   
2. **Anomaly 2 (Transitive Dependency):** The "Chelsea" total is incorrect, suggesting a transitive dependency where the total doesn't match the sum of the League, FA Cup, and Other goals.

3. **Anomaly 3 (Denormalization):** The "Fulham" total is incorrect, storing a static derived value rather than a dynamic summation.

4. **Anomaly 4 (Denormalization):** The overall "Career total" is incorrect, showcasing an incorrect derived value for total goals.

This modified dataset introduces normalization anomalies as follows:

1. **Repeating Groups (1NF Violation):** The `Total` column now stores multiple values as concatenated strings, violating the atomic value requirement of 1NF.

2. **Denormalization:** The `Total` column values are stored directly for each row as concatenated values, making it harder to dynamically compute them if needed.

By altering the `Total` column to contain concatenated values, we create a situation where the data structure is less efficient and violates normalization principles.

### Explanation of Anomalies Introduced:

1. **Repeating Groups (1NF Violation):**  
   - In row 7, the `Continental` column now contains "0, 1", indicating multiple values in a single column.

2. **Repeating Groups (1NF Violation):**  
   - In row 15, `League` now contains "4, 0", indicating multiple values within the same cell.

3. **Repeating Groups (1NF Violation):**  
   - In row 17, the `Total` column contains "0, 0", showing multiple values within a single cell.

4. **Repeating Groups (1NF Violation):**  
   - In row 19, `Continental` now includes "8, 0", reflecting multiple values in one cell.

5. **Denormalization:**  
   - The `Total` column value in row 17 is modified to "0, 0", which might not be computed based on other columns.

6. **Denormalization:**  
   - The `Total` column in row 19 now contains an aggregate value not directly computed from the other columns due to the introduced anomaly in `Continental`.

This modified dataset introduces a normalization anomaly by violating the 1NF rule, where the value in the "FA Cup" column for "Port Vale" in the "Total" season is non-atomic (i.e., it contains multiple values in a single cell).

### Explanation of Anomalies Introduced:

1. **Partial Dependencies (2NF Violation):**
   - Modified `Portsmouth` (1987–88) to have a total of 2 instead of 1, implying the `Total` depends only on the `League` column, not considering other columns like `FA Cup`, `League Cup`, and `Other`.

2. **Transitive Dependencies (3NF Violation):**
   - Adjusted `Stoke City` (1992–93) season where `Total` depends indirectly on the `League`, which creates a transitive dependency and redundancy.

3. **Denormalization:**
   - Modified `Portsmouth` (Season: Total) and `Stoke City` (Season: Total) to reflect incorrect cumulative totals that don't match the sum of individual entries, demonstrating denormalization through incorrect summary calculations.

4. **Repeating Groups (1NF Violation):**
   - No repeating groups were introduced, but `Total` columns were adjusted incorrectly to not match the sum of the individual goal categories, reflecting a single-field anomaly.

5. **Hierarchical Redundancy:**
   - Adjusted `Career Total` to show redundant totals that don't accurately reflect the sum of all club totals, illustrating hierarchical data stored in a non-normalized format.

6. **Lack of Temporal Normalization (6NF Violation):**
   - The `Career Total` row incorrectly aggregates new values, losing the historical accuracy of the actual season-by-season data, illustrating a failure to maintain historical state.

### Anomalies Introduced:

1. **Transitive Dependency (3NF Violation):**  
   - In 2010, the `Total` is modified to 3, which should be the sum of `League` and `Cup` but is not, creating a transitive dependency.

2. **Repeating Groups (1NF Violation):**  
   - In 2012, `League` contains "1,2", storing multiple values in a single field, violating atomicity.

3. **Denormalization:**  
   - In 2014, the `Total` is set to 2, which does not match the sum of `League` and `Cup`.

These modifications introduce normalization anomalies by creating inconsistencies and non-atomic values, demonstrating potential pitfalls in database design.

Here are the normalization anomalies introduced:

1. **Repeating Groups (1NF Violation):** In the "League Cup" column for "Bognor Regis Town" (2009–10), multiple values "2, 0" are stored instead of atomic values.
   
2. **Repeating Groups (1NF Violation):** In the "FA Cup" column for "Shrewsbury Town" (2015–16), multiple values "0, 1, 1" are stored, indicating non-atomic data.

These modifications introduce anomalies by violating the First Normal Form, as columns now contain multiple values, which should be separated into individual entries.

Explanation of the normalization anomalies introduced:
1. **Repeating Groups (1NF Violation):** 
   - In 1996, the `League` column now stores "0,1" instead of a single atomic value.
   
2. **Transitive Dependencies (3NF Violation):** 
   - In 2007, the `Other` column has been modified to store "2,3", indirectly suggesting a dependency on values other than the primary key.

3. **Partial Dependencies (2NF Violation):** 
   - The `Total` value for 2001 is incorrectly modified to 12, suggesting dependency only on the `League` and `Cup` columns rather than the full row context.

4. **Repeating Groups (1NF Violation):** 
   - In 2013, the `Total` column now stores "1,2", violating atomicity.

5. **Denormalization:**
   - The `Total` for 2001 and 2007 was altered such that it does not match the sum of `League`, `Cup`, and `Other`, suggesting stored derived values rather than computed on-the-fly.

6. **Partial Dependencies (2NF Violation):** 
   - The `League` column in 2007 contains multiple values "2,3," suggesting it depends only on part of a composite key, if existed.

These modifications introduce normalization anomalies, demonstrating a lack of adherence to standard database normalization forms.

Here are the normalization anomalies introduced:

1. **Denormalization:** For the record of "Wrexham" in the 1999–2000 season, the "Total" column was increased to 2, which does not match the sum of "League", "FA Cup", and "Other", introducing a denormalization anomaly.

2. **Denormalization:** For "Career Total", the "Total" column was increased to 3, which does not match the sum of "League", "FA Cup", and "Other".

3. **Denormalization:** The "Total" for the first three seasons of "Wrexham" was arbitrarily set to 1, despite the sum of "League", "FA Cup", and "Other" being 0. This reflects a stored value that does not align with computed totals.

These modifications introduce inconsistencies typical of denormalization anomalies, where computed data (like totals) does not reflect the raw data present in other columns.
