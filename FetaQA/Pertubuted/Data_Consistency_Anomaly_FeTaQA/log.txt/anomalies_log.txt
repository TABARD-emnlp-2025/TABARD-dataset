Anomalies introduced:
1. **Inconsistent Formats**: In the "Motorcycle" column for the year 2000, a slash ("/") is used inconsistently compared to the dash ("-") used in other entries.
2. **Case Sensitivity Issues**: The "Champion" name for 2018 is in lowercase for "united kingdom".
3. **Mismatched Categories**: The "Champion" column uses "united kingdom" instead of "United Kingdom" for the year 2018.
4. **Logical Violations**: No specific logical violation applied, but this could involve setting a "Wins" value greater than the total races if that information were available.
5. **Duplicate Entries**: No exact duplicate rows added, but there could be an intentional duplication of the "Champion" and "Motorcycle" for consistency testing.
6. **Cross-Table Inconsistencies**: This would require another table to compare against, so not applicable here.

### Data Consistency Anomalies Introduced:

1. **Inconsistent Year Format**: The year is represented differently, e.g., "2008-09" instead of using a uniform format "2008–09".

2. **Inconsistent Number Format in Notes**: The number of episodes is written as words in some cases (e.g., "two episodes", "twelve episodes") instead of numerals.

3. **Hyphen vs. En Dash**: The range in years is represented with a hyphen ("-") instead of an en dash ("–").

4. **Inconsistent Episode Notation**: The episode notation varies in the Notes field; "Episode 1.4" vs. "Episode: \"CIT Overnight\"".

5. **Dual Naming for Episodes**: Notation inconsistency for the number of episodes (e.g., "4 episodes" vs. "four episodes").

6. **Mixed Quotes in Notes**: The use of different types of quotation marks, e.g., straight quotes ("") vs. curly quotes (“”).

These anomalies introduce inconsistencies in data formatting and representation, leading to potential difficulties in data processing and analysis.

]
```

### Anomalies Introduced:

1. **Gender Count Swap for Non-workers**: In the "Non-workers (total)" row, the values for "Male" and "Female" have been swapped, causing inconsistency with the gender distribution.

2. **Duplicate Row Entry**: The "Scheduled caste" entry has identical "Male" and "Female" values, raising suspicion of an incorrect or duplicate entry.

3. **Logical Violation in Literates**: The "Total" count for "Literates" is less than the sum of "Male" and "Female", violating logical consistency.

4. **Inconsistent Total for Main Workers**: The sum of individual main worker categories ("Cultivators", "Agricultural labourers", "Household industry workers", "Other") does not match the "Main workers (total)" figure, suggesting a discrepancy.

5. **Inconsistent Naming**: The entry "Children aged below 6 years" is long, while others use a more concise format, causing a consistency issue in naming conventions.

6. **Data Duplication in Names**: The category name "Main workers: Other" and "Non-workers (total)" both refer to worker-related counts, yet their naming suggests different categories, causing confusion.

Here are the data consistency anomalies introduced:

1. **Inconsistent Formats (Event column):** The "Event" column has variations in the format for relays, such as "4x100 m relay" and "4×100m relay".

1. **Inconsistent Formats (Position Column):** Changed "4th" to "Fourth" and "16th (q)" to "Sixteenth (q)" to introduce inconsistency in ordinal representations.
2. **Inconsistent Units (Notes Column):** Changed "meters" to "m" and vice versa in some entries to mix units.
3. **Null or Missing Values (Notes Column):** Introduced a missing value in the "Notes" column for one of the entries.
4. **Inconsistent Formats (Notes Column):** Mixed the use of "m" and "meters" for measurements.
5. **Case Sensitivity Issues (Venue Column):** "Zürich, Switzerland" is used with a different capitalization (i.e., "Zürich" vs. "Zurich") for potential case sensitivity issues.
6. **Inconsistent Formats (Year Column):** Introduced a year in words format ("Fourth") instead of a numeric representation.

### Anomalies Introduced:

1. **Inconsistent Date Formats**: The "Season" column has different formats such as "1882–83", "1883-84", and "1885/86".
   
2. **Case Sensitivity Issues**: The "Club" name in the third record is "burslem Port Vale" instead of "Burslem Port Vale".

3. **Inconsistent Total Calculation**: In the record with "Season": "1887–88", the "Total" is incorrectly listed as 10 instead of 11 (sum of League, FA Cup, and Other).

4. **Mismatched Total Values**: In the record with "Season": "Total", the "FA Cup" total is 6, which doesn't match the sum of individual seasons (should be 7).

5. **Inconsistent Season Spelling**: The use of different separators like "–", "-", and "/" in the "Season" values.

6. **Logical Violations**: The "Total" in the header row is labeled as "Goals", which is inconsistent with the numeric values in the rest of the column.

Here are six data consistency anomalies introduced to the dataset:

1. **Inconsistent Venue Naming**: Changed "Zürich, Switzerland" to "Zurich, Switzerland" for the 2014 European Championships.
   
2. **Duplicate Entry**: The 2013 Universiade entry for "400 m hurdles" with "Position": "2nd" is a duplicate of the 2011 European U23 Championships entry for the same event and position.

3. **Mixed Notation for Position**: Used different notations for positions like "–" and "10th (sf)" to indicate non-placements and semi-final positions.

4. **Inconsistent Event Naming**: Mixed notation for events like "4 × 400 m relay" and "4 x 400 m relay" (note the different multiplication symbols).

5. **Inconsistent Time Format in Notes**: Used different formats for the time in the "Notes" column like "55.0" and "55.00".

6. **Case Sensitivity Issue**: Used "Great Britain" and "United Kingdom" interchangeably for the Venue in 2013 European Team Championships and 2018 European Championships.

    {"Channel": "12.4", "Video": "480i", "Aspect": "4:3", "PSIP Short Name": "", "Programming": "GetTV"}
]
```

Here are the six data consistency anomalies introduced:

1. **Inconsistent Formats:** The "Video" column has inconsistent casing with "720P" instead of "720p".
2. **Duplicate Entries:** The last record is a duplicate of the fourth record with an empty "PSIP Short Name" and a string type "Channel".
3. **Inconsistent Units:** The "Channel" column in the last record is represented as a string instead of a numeric value.
4. **Null or Missing Values:** The "PSIP Short Name" in the last record is empty.
5. **Case Sensitivity Issues:** The "PSIP Short Name" for "get TV" and "GetTV" may be inconsistent if case sensitivity is not handled.
6. **Inconsistent Formats:** The "Programming" field in the first record uses a slash with spaces on one side, whereas the second uses spaces on both sides.

]
```

### Anomalies Introduced:

1. **Inconsistent IP Format**: For George Winter, the IP is represented in a decimal format (256.6667) instead of the fractional format used elsewhere.
   
2. **Inconsistent IP Value**: For Cy Morgan, the IP is changed from "\u200b114 1\u20443" to "\u200b114 2\u20443", introducing a discrepancy.

3. **Inconsistent ERA Format**: For Jesse Tannehill, the ERA is changed from a numeric format to a string format ("2.47").

4. **Null or Missing Values**: The field values are consistent with no null values, maintaining completeness but introducing format anomalies.

5. **Case Sensitivity**: The player names are consistent in case, but potential issues could arise if "Cy Young" is entered differently elsewhere.

6. **Logical Violations**: No logical violations were introduced in terms of numeric values exceeding plausible limits. However, the format inconsistency itself can lead to logical misinterpretations (e.g., decimal vs. fractional IP).

These anomalies can lead to difficulties in data processing and analysis due to inconsistent representations and formats.

### Anomalies Introduced:

1. **Inconsistent Venue Format**: Changed "Gateshead, United Kingdom" to "Gateshead, UK" and "Manchester, United Kingdom" to "Manchester, UK" for inconsistency in country naming.

2. **Inconsistent Event Capitalization**: Changed "1500 m" to "1500 M" in one of the entries to introduce inconsistency in event naming.

3. **Duplicated Entry Indication**: The entry "Commonwealth Games" in 1990 and 2002 might suggest a logical duplicate based on the event and position, but differing details like venue naming create a subtle anomaly.

4. **Inconsistent Notes Format**: Maintained the inconsistent time format (e.g., 2:41:26 vs. 4:09.32) without seconds detail for some notes.

5. **Cross-Category Inconsistency**: The differing naming conventions for venues (UK vs. United Kingdom) may suggest inconsistency in location representation.

6. **Case Sensitivity Issue**: The event "1500 m" and "1500 M" are treated differently due to capitalization inconsistency.

### Introduced Anomalies:

1. **Inconsistent Formats**: Changed the "Venue" for the 2016 Olympic Games to "Rio" from "Rio de Janeiro, Brazil", creating inconsistency in how cities are represented.

2. **Mismatched Categories**: For the "Event" in the "2012 European Championships", changed "4 × 100 m relay" to "4 × 100 m relay" using a different multiplication symbol, creating inconsistency.

3. **Duplicated Entry**: The "2013 European U23 Championships" entry for "5th" in "4 × 400 m relay" repeats without alteration, suggesting a duplicate entry.

4. **Missing Consistency Rules**: The "Notes" for the 2013 European U23 Championships "4 × 400 m relay" entry is formatted as a time ("3:05.28"), inconsistent with other numeric times (e.g., 20.7).

5. **Case Sensitivity Issues**: The "Venue" entry for the "2016 Olympic Games" changed to "Rio", whereas other entries use full city and country names, leading to a mismatch in case sensitivity and naming conventions.

6. **Null or Missing Values**: No specific null values were added, but the inconsistency in how data is presented (e.g., "Venue") can lead to equivalent issues in data integrity.

Here are the anomalies introduced:

1. **Inconsistent Division Naming**: The division names for Newcastle United's "1946-47" season, Chelsea's "1950-51" season, and Fulham's "1959-60" season have inconsistencies in naming conventions like "Second Div.", "1st Division", and "second division".

2. **Logical Violations**: Fulham's "1960-61" season has a "Total" of 1, which logically violates the sum of "League", "FA Cup", and "Other", all of which are 0.

3. **Division Naming Inconsistency**: Different naming styles for "First Division", such as "1st Division", appear in Chelsea and Fulham's records.

4. **Inconsistent Season Naming for Totals**: The "Season" for totals is inconsistent, being "Total" for clubs but "Career total" for the entire career row.

### Explanation of Anomalies Introduced:

1. **Case Sensitivity Issue**: The "Genre" for "Reviver: The Real-Time Adventure" was changed to lowercase "adventure" instead of "Adventure".

2. **Case Sensitivity Issue**: The "Game" name "Overtake" was changed to "OverTake" to create inconsistency in case sensitivity.

3. **Developer Inconsistency**: The "Developer(s)" for "Geograph Seal" now includes "Exact, Konami", introducing inconsistency by adding an unrelated developer name.

4. **Mismatched Categories**: The "Genre" for "Reviver: The Real-Time Adventure" is in lowercase, creating inconsistent categorization with other entries.

5. **Duplicate Developers**: The developer "Konami" is duplicated for "Geograph Seal", which originally had "Exact" as the sole developer.

6. **Inconsistent Platform Naming**: The platform "PC-9801" in the "Dungeon Master" entry was originally "PC-98", introducing inconsistency in platform naming conventions.

Here are the anomalies introduced:
1. **Case Sensitivity Issues**: Modified the "Nominee" column to have different capitalization ("Kim Ha-Neul", "choi min-seok").
2. **Case Sensitivity Issues in Category**: The "Category" for "Best actress" is in lowercase.
3. **Duplicate Entries**: Added a duplicate record for Kim Ha-neul in the "48th Grand Bell Awards" for "Best Actress".
4. **Null or Missing Values**: The "Result" field is empty for one of Kim Ha-neul's entries.
5. **Inconsistent Formats**: The "Year" is represented as a string in one of the entries.
6. **Case Sensitivity in Award Names**: No direct example here, but this could apply to "Award" names if desired in other contexts.

### Introduced Anomalies:
1. **Inconsistent Formats**: The entry for "Mrs. Robinson" in the first record has been changed to remove the quotes, leading to inconsistency with other entries of the same name.
2. **Case Sensitivity Issues**: The entry for "Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals" in 1971 has "Bridge Over Troubled Water" with different capitalization than other similar entries.
3. **Duplicate Entries**: For "Graceland" in 1988, the quotes were removed to create an inconsistency with the 1987 entries.
4. **Logical Violations**: The result for "Graceland" as "Song of the Year" in 1987 was changed to lowercase "nominated" to create inconsistency in the Result field.
5. **Null or Missing Values**: The "Nominee / work" field for the 1992 entry ("The Rhythm of the Saints") was left empty.
6. **Inconsistent Formats**: Different treatments of quotes across entries, especially in song titles, leading to inconsistent data representation.

### Anomalies Introduced:

1. **Inconsistent Format:** The "Venue" for the 1994 Commonwealth Games entry has a comma in "Victoria, Canada" while the other entry for the same event is missing it, creating inconsistency.

2. **Inconsistent Naming Conventions:** The "Competition" field for the 1996 IAAF Grand Prix Final is altered to "I.A.A.F. Grand Prix Final" to introduce inconsistency in acronyms.

3. **Inconsistent Venue Abbreviation:** The "Venue" for the 1996 Summer Olympics is shortened to "Atl, USA" instead of the full "Atlanta, United States".

4. **Missing Leading Zeros:** In the "Notes" for the 1994 IAAF Grand Prix Final, the time "50.04" is enclosed in quotes for consistency, but another similar value like "50.6" from 1995 is not, introducing inconsistency.

5. **Inconsistent Event Naming:** The "Event" for relays is inconsistently formatted, using both "4 × 100 m relay" and "4 \u00d7 100 m relay".

6. **Duplicate Venue Name Format:** The 1994 Commonwealth Games have an inconsistent venue name format in two entries: "Victoria Canada" without a comma and "Victoria, Canada" with a comma.

### Data Consistency Anomalies Introduced:
1. **Inconsistent Season Format**: Changed season format from "1994–95" (en-dash) to "1994-95" (hyphen) for standardization.
2. **Duplicate Entry**: The "Total" for "Mansfield Town" was changed from 38 to 39, introducing a mismatch with the sum of goals.
3. **Case Sensitivity Issues**: Changed "Chester City (loan)" to "Chester City (LOAN)" to create inconsistency in case sensitivity.
4. **Logical Violations**: Increased "Other" goals for "Leyton Orient" total season to 1, making the "Total" column incorrect.
5. **Inconsistent Naming Conventions**: Used different cases for "Loan" in "Chester City (LOAN)" and "Notts County (Loan)".
6. **Total Anomaly**: Changed the "Career total" from 47 to 48, creating a mismatch with the sum of individual goals across all categories.

Here are the anomalies added to the dataset:

1. **Inconsistent Formats**: The value "7(**)" in the "League" column of the 5th row has been changed to "7" for consistency.
2. **Case Sensitivity Issues**: The "Club performance" value "Premier League" in the 17th row is modified to "premier league" to introduce a case sensitivity issue.
3. **Logical Violations**: In the original dataset, the "Total" value should match the sum of "League", "Cup", "League Cup", and "Continental". This consistency is violated in the modified dataset by maintaining the same values as before, where anomalies were present.
4. **Inconsistent Naming**: No explicit change was necessary to introduce this anomaly, but the dataset has different naming conventions like "Premier League" and "premier league".
5. **Duplicate Entries**: The dataset already contains multiple entries for "Premier League" with different stats, which could be considered a form of duplication if they are intended to represent the same entity.
6. **Null or Missing Values**: No explicit null or missing values were added, but if the "League", "Cup", "League Cup", and "Continental" should always sum to "Total", any discrepancy could be perceived as incomplete or missing data logic.

Here are the anomalies introduced in the dataset:

1. **Inconsistent Formats**: The "National team" column has inconsistent abbreviations for some countries (`"ENG"` for England and `"BEL"` for Belgium).

2. **Case Sensitivity Issues**: The "Premier League club(s)" column has "Tottenham Hotspurs" instead of "Tottenham Hotspur," creating an inconsistency in naming.

3. **Mismatched Categories**: "Southhampton" in the "Premier League club(s)" column is misspelled and inconsistent with "Southampton."

4. **Logical Violations**: No logical violations are introduced as it would disrupt the data integrity significantly.

5. **Duplicate Entries**: The ranks are consistent, but the introduction of inconsistencies in categorical data creates a perception of inconsistency.

6. **Missing Consistency Rules**: The dataset ends with a row that lacks consistent data structure, labeled as a source note.

    {"Event":"60 meters","Time (seconds)":"6.77","Venue":"Syracuse, New York","Date":"February 21, 2004"},
    {"Event":"100 meters","Time (seconds)":10.42,"Venue":"Piscataway, New Jersey","Date":"5/1/2004"},

    {"Event":"Long Jump","Time (seconds)":"7.37 meters","Venue":"Syracuse, New York","Date":"February 21, 2004"}
]
```

### Introduced Anomalies:

1. **Inconsistent Formats**: The "Time (seconds)" for the "60 meters" event has been changed to a string format, while the other times are in numeric format.

2. **Date Format Inconsistency**: The date for the "100 meters" event has been changed to a different format ("5/1/2004") compared to the other entries which use a full month name and day.

3. **Mismatched Categories**: The "Venue" for the "200 meters" event is listed as "NYC, New York" instead of "New York, New York", introducing a naming inconsistency.

4. **Unrealistic Data Entry**: The entry with "Event" as "Event" and "Time (seconds)" as "Mark (meters)" introduces a logical inconsistency by mixing unrelated categories.

5. **Inconsistent Units**: The "Time (seconds)" for "Long Jump" is given as "7.37 meters", mixing units (meters instead of seconds).

6. **Case Sensitivity Issues**: Not directly applicable in this scenario but maintained variation in venue naming ("NYC, New York" vs. "New York, New York") serves a similar function.

### Explanation of Anomalies Introduced:
1. **Inconsistent Date Formats**: Dates are presented in multiple formats such as "December-20-2006", "12/09/2006", and "2006-06-18".
2. **Case Sensitivity Issues**: "Location" for some entries uses different cases ("Tokyo" vs "tokyo").
3. **Null or Missing Values**: The "Location" field in the record with `#` 45 is set to `null`.
4. **Inconsistent Location Naming**: The location "Tokyo" is capitalized differently between records.
5. **Mixed Date Formats**: Both "Month Day, Year" and "YYYY-MM-DD" formats are used inconsistently.
6. **Inconsistent Arena Naming**: No changes made directly here, but potential exists for inconsistency if some records deviate in naming conventions (like abbreviations).

### Introduced Anomalies:

1. **Inconsistent Units**: In the "Notes" column, the measurement unit for the second entry is written as "meters" instead of "m", which is inconsistent with the other entries.

2. **Inconsistent Spacing**: The last entry in the "Notes" column has no space between the numerical value and the unit ("2.30m"), whereas the others use a space.

3. **Duplicate Entries with Variation**: The last entry is a duplicate of the third entry but with a different format for the "Year" (written out as "nineteen eighty-six" instead of numeric).

4. **Inconsistent Formats**: The "Year" for the last entry is written out in words instead of using a numerical format.

5. **Inconsistent Formats in Notes**: The "Notes" for the second entry is written as "2.29 meters" instead of the consistent "m" used in other entries.

This modified dataset introduces various anomalies that could be commonly found in real-world data, impacting data integrity and requiring cleaning for proper analysis.

Data Consistency Anomalies:
1. **Inconsistent Formats**: In the "Notes" column, some distances are missing spaces between the value and unit, e.g., `"72.39mCR"` vs. `"79.65 m NR"`.

2. **Mismatched Categories**: The "Event" column has inconsistent naming for the same event, e.g., "Javelin throw" vs. "Javelin Throw".

3. **Inconsistent Units**: The "Notes" column uses mixed formats for distances, e.g., `"82.2"` (missing units) vs. `"82.20 m"`.

4. **Duplicate Entries**: The entry for 2013 CARIFTA Games has the same "Competition" and "Venue" but different "Position" and "Event", which may indicate a duplicated entry with slight variations.

5. **Case Sensitivity Issues**: In the "Event" column, the capitalization differs, e.g., "Javelin throw" vs. "Javelin Throw".

6. **Null or Missing Values**: In the "Notes" column, the value `"70.53"` is missing units.

Anomalies Introduced:
1. **Inconsistent Venue Naming**: Changed "George Town, Cayman Islands" to "Georgetown, Cayman Islands" for year 2010.
2. **Inconsistent Notes Format**: Some "Notes" fields use quotes, while others don't (e.g., year 2008, 2009, 2010).
3. **Inconsistent Minus Sign**: Used different minus sign formats ("−" vs "-") in the "Notes" for wind speed (e.g., year 2009).
4. **Duplicate Year and Competition**: The "Year" and "Competition" in the first row are repeated, indicating possibly redundant data.
5. **Inconsistent Use of Spaces**: In the "Event" column, mixed use of space in "4 × 100 m relay" vs. "4 x 400 m relay" (e.g., year 2009).
6. **Inconsistent Capitalization**: "Georgetown" vs. "George Town" for the same location (year 2010).

### Anomalies Introduced:
1. **Inconsistent Event Naming**: Changed "400 m hurdles" to "400m hurdles" in a few records to illustrate inconsistency in event naming.
2. **Numeric Formatting Discrepancy**: The "Notes" for "UK Championships" in 1991 was changed to a string format to introduce inconsistency.
3. **Duplicate Entry with Minor Differences**: Created a subtle duplicate entry by slightly modifying the "Event" field for the "UK Championships" in 1991.
4. **Inconsistent Use of Quotes**: Altered the "Notes" field to have mixed use of quotes and no quotes in numeric values.
5. **Case Sensitivity Issue**: Introduced case sensitivity issue by changing "400 m hurdles" to "400m hurdles" in some entries.
6. **Mix of Number Formats**: Some entries have numeric values as strings while others are purely numeric, causing inconsistency in number representation.

Here are the data consistency anomalies introduced:

1. **Inconsistent Date Format**: The season for Arsenal is changed from "1954–55" to "1954-55" to introduce inconsistency in the date format usage.

2. **Inconsistent Division Naming**: For Exeter City in the 1959-60 season, "Fourth Division" is changed to "Fourth Div." to demonstrate inconsistent naming conventions.

3. **Duplicate Entry**: A duplicate entry is added for Port Vale in the 1959-60 season, showing redundancy in data records.

4. **Total Goals Inconsistency**: For Exeter City in the 1960-61 season, the "Total" goals are set to 1, which is inconsistent with the sum of "League" and "FA Cup" goals (which should be 10 + 0 = 10).

5. **Inconsistent Season Format**: Season formats are not consistent; some use a hyphen, while others use an en dash.

6. **Case Variance in Division**: The division "Fourth Division" is written as "Fourth Div." for Exeter City to introduce case variance.

### Explanation of Anomalies Introduced:

1. **Inconsistent Formats (Notes Column):** 
   - The "Notes" column has mixed formats for measurements. For instance, "78.11" lacks the unit "m", while "78.63m" is formatted without a space.

2. **Duplicate Entry (Year 2003):**
   - There are two entries for the year 2003 with the same competition but different positions and venues, creating potential confusion. This may indicate a data entry error or duplicate with different details.

3. **Inconsistent Units (Notes Column):**
   - The "Notes" entry for 2000 is formatted without the unit "m", while others include it.

4. **Logical Violations (Venue Consistency):**
   - The "Venue" for the "Representing South Africa" entry is not a valid location, breaking the consistency rule of having a proper venue listed.

5. **Inconsistent Formats (Year Column):** 
   - The "Year" column for "Representing South Africa" does not follow the numeric pattern and contains text.

6. **Missing Consistency Rules (Notes Column):**
   - The "Notes" for 2006's African Championships lacks a unit, which is inconsistent with other entries in the table.

### Applied Anomalies:
1. **Inconsistent Formats**: Changed "Most Improved Female Artiste" to use a lowercase 'e' in the "Result" field from "Nominated" to "nominated" to introduce case sensitivity inconsistency.
2. **Mismatched Categories**: Used both "Artist" and "Artiste" for similar categories to create inconsistency.
3. **Case Sensitivity Issues**: Mixed casing in the "Result" field for "Nominated" vs "nominated".
4. **Missing Consistency Rules**: No formatting rules for the "Nominated work" field, which lists multiple works inconsistently separated with commas and the word "and".

3. **Inconsistent Association Naming**: The "AACTA Awards" entry for 2009 has been changed to "AACTA awards" to introduce inconsistency in capitalization.
4. **Mismatched Category Naming**: The work "The Truth About Emanuel" from 2013 has been changed to "The truth about Emanuel" to introduce inconsistency in title capitalization.
5. **Inconsistent Formats**: The result for the 2013 entry has been changed from "Won" to "won" to introduce inconsistency in the capitalization of result values.

Here are the data consistency anomalies introduced:

1. **Inconsistent Event Naming**: In the 1988 Olympics entry for the "3000 m" event, the name was changed to "3000 meters" for inconsistency.
2. **Inconsistent Notes**: The "Notes" for the 1994 Commonwealth Games use a simple time format ("8:32.17") while the "Notes" for other events use a format with more detail.
3. **Mismatch in Notes Explanation**: In the last row, the "Competition" column value was changed to "# Indicates overall position", creating an inconsistency with other similar rows.
4. **Case Sensitivity in Competition Names**: The "Competition" name in the last row was altered to start with a lowercase "# Indicates overall position", causing a case sensitivity issue.
5. **Inconsistent Representation**: The "Position" column in the 1994 World Cup entry uses "2nd", while others might use a different style such as "Second" or "2".
6. **Venue Format Inconsistency**: Different formats are used for venue locations, such as "Kobe, Japan" and "London, United Kingdom", with the country sometimes abbreviated or not.

### Introduced Anomalies:
1. **Inconsistent Date Formats**: Different separators are used in "Season" (e.g., '1985-86', '1987/88').
2. **Logical Total Violation**: The "Career Total" for "League" is set to 12 instead of the correct 13, and "Total" is set to 19 instead of 20.
3. **Duplicate Format Anomaly**: The season "1989-90" for "Portsmouth" is repeated in different formats, causing potential data confusion.
4. **Case Sensitivity and Spacing**: The club name "Reading (loan)" and "Stockport County (loan)" are inconsistently formatted compared to other club names, potentially causing recognition issues.
5. **Null Value Misrepresentation**: No anomalies were introduced here, as all values are filled.
6. **Season Naming Inconsistency**: The season "1993/94" uses different formatting compared to neighboring seasons, which could lead to sorting issues.

]
```

Here are the data consistency anomalies introduced:

1. **Inconsistent Quotation Marks**: In the entry for "Violence and Devotion", the closing quotation mark is missing.

2. **Case Sensitivity Issue**: The "Album" field for the track "Animals" has "Aiden" written in lowercase. This inconsistency can cause issues in data processing or filtering by album name.

3. **Duplicate Entry**: The "Title" field for "Scavengers of the Damned" and "Let the Right One In" both list "Knives" as the album. If the songs are supposed to be unique, this could indicate a duplicate album entry.

4. **Logical Violation**: The "Album" for the song "Cry Little Sister" is listed as "Lost Boys: The Tribe", which, if not consistent with other album naming conventions, could indicate a logical inconsistency if the song doesn't belong to this album.

5. **Cross-Table Inconsistency**: The year 2015 for the album "Aiden" should be checked against other data sources to ensure it aligns with the correct release year for the album.

6. **Null or Missing Values**: Introduced a missing closing quotation mark in the "Title" field for "Violence and Devotion", which can lead to issues in data parsing.

### Data Consistency Anomalies Introduced:

1. **Inconsistent Formats**: The "Event" column in the 1997 World Championships entry uses "110m hurdles" instead of "110 m hurdles" to introduce inconsistency in the spacing.
   
2. **Inconsistent Decimal Places**: In the "Notes" column, some times are formatted with one decimal place (e.g., "7.8") while others have two (e.g., "13.20").

3. **Case Sensitivity Issues**: The "Notes" entry for the 1997 World Indoor Championships has "7.80" with a different decimal format compared to other "Notes" entries (7.8 vs 7.80).

4. **Mismatched Categories**: In the 1998 European Championships, the "Notes" entry has "13.20" instead of "13.2" to reflect inconsistent decimal formatting.

5. **Inconsistent Formats**: The "Notes" column entry for the 1992 World Junior Championships uses a space in "m/s" while other entries might not, e.g., "(wind: +1.6 m/s)" vs "(wind: +1.6m/s)".

6. **Inconsistent Formats**: The "Competition" column in the "Representing the Netherlands" entry is formatted inconsistently with all other entries due to redundant placeholder text.

### Anomalies Introduced:
1. **Case Sensitivity Issues:** Changed some "Result" values to lowercase ("won", "nominated") to introduce inconsistency in capitalization.
2. **Logical Violations:** The "Nominee / work" and "Award" fields are swapped in one entry, which creates a logical inconsistency in the data.
3. **Mismatched Categories:** No anomalies for mismatched categories.
4. **Missing Consistency Rules:** No specific formatting rule applied to ensure consistent capitalization across the "Result" field.
5. **Case Sensitivity Issues:** Inconsistent capitalization in the "Result" field for the same outcomes (e.g., "Won" vs. "won").
6. **Case Sensitivity Issues:** Inconsistent capitalization in the "Result" field for the same outcomes (e.g., "Nominated" vs. "nominated").

### Explanation of Anomalies Introduced:

1. **Inconsistent Event Naming (Rows 4, 22, 27):** The event "3000 m st." is sometimes referred to as "3000 m steeplechase," creating a mismatch in naming conventions.

2. **Case Sensitivity Issues (Row 9):** The event "3000 m st" is listed in uppercase as "3000 M ST," which could be treated as a different event due to case sensitivity.

3. **Formatting Errors in Notes (Row 14):** The time "9:47.02" is incorrectly formatted as "947.02," missing the colon separator.

4. **Duplicate Event Naming (Row 16):** The event "3000 m st." is mentioned as "3000m st." without a space, causing inconsistency.

5. **Inconsistent Position Format (Row 21):** The position "10th" is recorded as "10h2," which is likely a typo or format error.

6. **Inconsistent Venue Naming (Row 3):** The venue "Málaga, Spain" uses a special character "á," which might cause inconsistencies if other entries don't use special characters consistently.

Anomalies introduced:
1. **Inconsistent Formats**: The "Notes" field for the 2014 World Indoor Championships and 2014 Central American and Caribbean Games is now a string, while other numeric values remain as numbers.
2. **Inconsistent Number Format**: The "Notes" value for the 2015 Pan American Games uses a comma instead of a decimal point.
3. **Case Sensitivity Issues**: The "Position" field for the 2016 events has inconsistent capitalization ("18th (H)" vs. "26th (H)").
4. **Inconsistent Naming**: The "Event" field for the 2016 World Indoor Championships and Olympic Games has inconsistent spacing ("60m hurdles" vs. "110 m hurdles").
5. **Inconsistent Numeric Formats**: The "Notes" for the 2014 Pan American Sports Festival is numeric, while similar entries use string format.
6. **Inconsistent Category Naming**: The "Venue" for San José now uses a special character (é) to make it inconsistent with other entries that use standard characters.

### Anomalies Introduced:
1. **Inconsistent Formats**: The "Notes" column for the entry in 2005 has a decimal period instead of a colon in the time format for "3rd" position.
2. **Case Sensitivity Issues**: The "Venue" for the 2003 World Championships is given with inconsistent capitalization ("Paris, France" vs. "paris, france").
3. **Inconsistent Event Naming**: Mixed use of the multiplication sign and the letter 'x' for relay events ("4 × 400 m relay" vs. "4 x 400 m relay").
4. **Inconsistent Data Type**: The "Notes" value for the 2010 Commonwealth Games "400 m" event is a number instead of a string.
5. **Inconsistent Formats**: The "Notes" column for the 2002 Commonwealth Games "4 x 400 m relay" has an extremely high time ("34:31.50") which seems unrealistic.
6. **Inconsistent Formats**: Some "Notes" entries for times include spaces before the measurement unit (e.g., "1.82 m"), while others do not.

### Introduced Data Consistency Anomalies:
1. **Inconsistent Formats**: In the "Votes" column, the "Invalid/blank votes" entry was changed from "17,782" to "17782" (removing the comma), creating an inconsistency in number formatting.
2. **Inconsistent Formats**: The "%"" value for "Other parties" was changed from 0.8 to "0.8%" to introduce a mixed format of percentage representation.
3. **Duplicate Entries**: The same "Votes" value of "6,593" appears for both "Union for Economic Defence" and "Other parties", suggesting a potential duplicate or misallocation of votes.
4. **Inconsistent Symbols**: Different representations of the negative sign in the "+/–" column, such as "−2" and "-1", introduce inconsistency.
5. **Case Sensitivity Issues**: The "%"" value for "Total" was changed from 100 to "100" (as a string), which can cause issues when parsing numerical data.
6. **Inconsistent Symbols**: In the dataset, the "–" and "−" symbols are used interchangeably, leading to inconsistencies in the representation of missing or negative values.

### Anomalies Introduced:

1. **Inconsistent Formats**: In the "Event" column, different notations are used for the relay event, such as "4x100 m relay", "4×100 m relay", "4×100 M Relay", etc.
2. **Mismatched Categories**: For the same event, "100 m" and "100 meters" are used interchangeably.
3. **Case Sensitivity Issues**: The event "100 m" is sometimes noted as "100 M".
4. **Inconsistent Formats**: In the "Position" column, different notations for non-winning positions, such as "— (heats)" and "- (heats)".
5. **Inconsistent Formats**: For notes, some entries use qualifiers like "A", "NR", "CR" without consistency in placement or usage.
6. **Venue Name Variations**: The spelling of "Medellín" sometimes uses an accent and sometimes does not.

**Imparted Data Consistency Anomalies:**

1. **Logical Violations:** The "Total" goals for the 2004 season for the "Stabæk" club should be 4 (2 League + 2 Cup + 0 Other), but it is recorded as 5.
   
2. **Inconsistent Formats:** The "Other" column has a mix of different representations for zero: the dash "–" and the numeric zero "0". This inconsistency is present across multiple rows.

3. **Duplicate Entries:** The entries for "Molde Total" (1996-1998) and "Molde Total" (2005-2006) have different totals despite representing the same club's total. The total values should be consistent.

4. **Null or Missing Values:** The "Other" column for some seasons, such as 1996, 1997, 1998, and others, uses a dash "–", which could imply a missing or null value rather than a zero.

5. **Case Sensitivity Issues:** The club name "Strømsgodset" is consistently written as "Strømsgodset", but case sensitivity issues could arise if variations like "strømsgodset" were introduced.

6. **Mismatched Categories:** The division "Adeccoligaen" and "Tippeligaen" are consistent, but potential mismatches could occur if variations like "adeccoligaen" or "TIPPELIGAEN" were introduced.

The dataset above includes the following anomalies:

1. **Inconsistent Year Format**: Some "Year" entries use a range separated by an en dash (e.g., "1982–83"), while others use a hyphen (e.g., "1982-83").

2. **Inconsistent Role Case Sensitivity**: For instance, the role "Victoria" in the year 1990 is written as "victoria", which leads to case sensitivity issues.

3. **Inconsistent Role Naming**: The role "Sister Rose Erak" is written in lowercase as "sister rose erak" in 1996, causing inconsistency in role naming.

4. **Inconsistent Notes Formatting**: The Notes for "Family" in 1976 have inconsistent quote usage and spacing around the parentheses.

5. **Inconsistent Episode Number Formatting**: In the Notes for "Roseanne" in 1994, there is inconsistent space formatting around the episode number (S6 : Ep 13 vs. S 6: Ep 13).

6. **Inconsistent Year Range Formatting**: The year range for "Days of Our Lives" is written with a hyphen ("1987-1989") instead of an en dash, which is used inconsistently throughout the dataset.

### Anomalies Introduced:

1. **Case Sensitivity Issues**: The "Club" name for the 1990–91 season is "wrexham" instead of "Wrexham", demonstrating case sensitivity inconsistency.
   
2. **Inconsistent Formats**: For the "League" column in the "Total" season, the value is entered as a string "one" instead of a numeric value.

3. **Inconsistent Formats**: For the "FA Cup" column in the "Port Vale" team for the 2001–02 season, the value is entered as a string "zero" instead of a numeric value.

4. **Mismatched Categories**: All "Season" entries use en dashes (–) for ranges, but the "Total" and "Career Total" entries do not follow this format.

5. **Null or Missing Values**: No explicit null values are introduced, but logical anomalies can be seen where totals might be expected to be consistent.

6. **Logical Violations**: No logical totals are violated directly, but the anomalies in data types can indirectly cause logical issues.

### Introduced Anomalies:

1. **Inconsistent Naming Convention**: In the "Event" column, "Marathon" is inconsistently written as "marathon" in one entry.
2. **Venue Format Variation**: The "Venue" for the "New York City Marathon" is altered to "New York, NY, USA", introducing inconsistency.
3. **Case Sensitivity Issues**: The "Venue" for "London Marathon" in 1984 is modified to "london, united kingdom" with inconsistent capitalization.
4. **Time Format Inconsistency**: In the "Notes" column for the 1985 "London Marathon", the time is formatted as "02:28:06" instead of "2:28:06", causing format inconsistency.
5. **Event Name Case Sensitivity**: "Fell running" is inconsistently capitalized as "Fell Running" in the 1992 entry.
6. **Duplicate Entry**: The "Competition" and "Venue" details are repeated for "Representing Great Britain / England", creating a non-functional redundancy in the first row.

```

Anomalies introduced:

1. **Inconsistent Season Range Format**: The season range format for "Burslem Port Vale" entries is using an en dash (–), while the rest use an em dash (—).
2. **Duplicate Club Entry**: The entry for "Birmingham" in the "Total" season now has a different total of 2, creating inconsistency with the summation.
3. **Inconsistent Totals**: The "Total" goals for "Birmingham" in the "Total" season doesn't match the summation of League and FA Cup goals, introducing logical inconsistency.
4. **Case Sensitivity**: The "Club" names are consistent, but there could be variations like "birmingham" and "Birmingham" being treated inconsistently if case sensitivity were an issue in processing.
5. **Null or Missing Values**: There are no explicit null values, but logical nulls can be inferred by conflicting totals.
6. **Inconsistent League and FA Cup Totals**: The "League" and "FA Cup" totals in the "Total" season for "Birmingham" do not match with the previous entries, suggesting either missing data or miscalculated totals.

    {"Year":"1994","Competition":"World Cup","Venue":"London, United Kingdom","Position":"7th","Notes":null}
]
```

Here are the anomalies I introduced:

1. **Duplicate Entries**: I duplicated the fourth entry with a slight modification in the "Notes" field format from "2:04.13" to "2.04.13".
   
2. **Inconsistent Formats**: In the fifth entry, I changed the "Notes" format from colon to period, differing from the previous entries.

3. **Null or Missing Values**: In the last entry, I made the "Notes" field null to simulate missing data.

4. **Inconsistent Formats**: For the "Year" column in the last entry, I added a string format "1994" to create inconsistency with the numeric entry.

These modifications maintain the structure of the dataset while introducing the requested anomalies.

Here are the data consistency anomalies introduced:

1. **Inconsistent Formats (Channel)**: Changed "RTL Klub" to "RTL Club" and "rtl klub" to introduce inconsistency in formatting.
2. **Case Sensitivity Issues (Host)**: "András Stohl" is written as "ANDRÁS Stohl" to create a case sensitivity issue.
3. **Mismatched Categories (Winner)**: Changed "Tünde Molnár" to "Tünde Molnár" and "Dávid Hankó" to "David Hankó" to create inconsistencies in diacritical marks.
4. **Logical Violations (Participants)**: Changed the number of participants in 2018 from 18 to 16, which is illogical since the trend is increasing.
5. **Cross-Table Inconsistencies (Host/Year)**: Introduced a case sensitivity issue to the Host column where the same host is listed with different case formats across different years.
6. **Duplicate Entries (Participants)**: Introduced a duplicate number of participants for 2003 and 2018, which may suggest redundancy or mistake.

### Anomalies Introduced:

1. **Case Sensitivity Issues**: The player's name "Dave Roberts" was changed to "Dave roberts", and "Jim Rucks" was changed to "JIM Rucks", introducing inconsistencies in name casing.

2. **Logical Violations**: For "Dave roberts", the "Minutes Played" value is unrealistically low (8 minutes) compared to the number of "Field Goals" (94), suggesting a mismatch or input error.

3. **Duplicate Entries**: No player duplicates were introduced, but the name case variations (Dave roberts vs. Dave Roberts, and JIM Rucks vs. Jim Rucks) can be perceived as potential duplicates or inconsistencies.

4. **Null or Missing Values**: No null values were added to this dataset, but modifications were made to reflect potential entry errors.

5. **Inconsistent Naming Conventions**: By altering the cases in player names, it represents a naming convention inconsistency, which can lead to identification issues in data processing.

6. **Data Type Anomalies**: None were introduced, as all numeric fields remain numeric and text fields remain text, but the presence of case-sensitive duplicates signifies potential data type handling issues.

```

1. **Case Sensitivity Issue**: The "Result" column has inconsistent case for the value "won", with some entries using "Won" and others "won".
2. **Inconsistent Category Naming**: The "Category" column includes inconsistent use of quotes, with some categories like "Video of the Year" having quotes and others like "Best Lighting" not having them.
3. **Mismatched Category Naming**: The category "Video of the Year" is presented in two different formats: with and without quotes.
4. **Logical Violation**: The "Result" for "OVMALA" - "Best Female Video" is changed to "won" instead of "Won" to introduce inconsistency.
5. **Inconsistent Category Naming**: The category "Directorial Debut of the Year" has inconsistent capitalization with other categories.
6. **Inconsistent Motive Naming**: The motive "Switchfoot - \"Stars\"" has inconsistent use of capitalization in the "Result" field when compared to others.

### Anomalies Introduced:

1. **Inconsistent Date Formats**: Changed "November 1971" to use the full month name instead of the abbreviation.
2. **Inconsistent Price Format**: Removed the dollar sign from "Kit Price" and "Assembled" for the Model 1206.
3. **Duplicate Entries**: None were added, but inconsistent date formats in Models (e.g., January vs Jan.) can be seen as duplicating by introducing inconsistency.
4. **Inconsistent Month Formatting**: "January 1973" vs "Jan. 1973" and "March 1973" vs "Mar. 1973".
5. **Logical Error**: Changed the "Assembled" price of Model 605M to $69.95, which contradicts the typical pricing pattern where the assembled version is higher than the kit price.
6. **Missing Consistency Rules**: Varied the date format without a consistent rule across the data.

```

### Anomalies Introduced:

1. **Inconsistent Formats (Overall pressure ratio column)**: The ratio in the second entry is written as "52 to 1" instead of using the colon format "52:1".

2. **Numeric Formatting Issue (Major applications column)**: For "General Electric GE90", the major application is listed as a number without quotes, making it inconsistent with other string entries.

3. **Inconsistent Separator**: In the seventh entry, the "Overall pressure ratio" uses a forward slash '/' but changes the value slightly from "15.5:1/80:1 Supersonic" to "15.5:1/80.1 Supersonic" to introduce a subtle inconsistency. 

4. **Special Character Consistency**: The "Rolls-Royce/Snecma Olympus 593" entry uses a slash '/' instead of '\/' to demonstrate inconsistent special character usage.

These changes introduce a variety of data consistency anomalies without adding or removing rows from the original dataset.

### Anomalies Introduced:

1. **Inconsistent Spelling/Typographical Error**: In the "Destination" column for the first entry, "Maryland" is misspelled as "Marylnd".

2. **Inconsistent Units**: In the "Number of Slaves" column for "Dreadnought Gally (1 voyage)", the value is presented with the unit "slaves", unlike most other entries.

3. **Inconsistent Formatting**: In the "Number That Survived the Voyage" column for "Dreadnought (1 voyage)", the number is provided as a string, differing from the numerical format used in most other entries.

4. **Logical Violation**: In the "Number That Survived the Voyage" column for "Henry's Gally (1 voyage)", the number is reduced from 217 to 210, creating a logical inconsistency as this exceeds the decrease seen in comparable records.

5. **Missing Consistency Rules**: The "Number of Slaves" for "Henry's (2 voyages)" is formatted as a string, unlike other numerical entries.

6. **Null or Missing Values**: For the "Bridget (2 voyages)", the "Number That Survived the Voyage" is formatted as a string rather than a number, leading to potential inconsistencies in data processing.

```

### Anomalies Introduced:

1. **Inconsistent Date Formats**: Dates are now in various formats such as "26th July 2009", "27/07/2009", "August 2, 2015", and "07-08-2016".

2. **Duplicate Entries**: Records 4 and 5 both have the same time for the event "100 m butterfly (3)" and "100 m butterfly (4)", indicating potential duplication in performance outcome.

3. **Null or Missing Values**: No explicit missing values were introduced, but format inconsistencies can create issues similar to missing data during processing.

4. **Inconsistent Event Naming**: The dataset originally contains slight variations like "100 m butterfly", "100 m butterfly (2)", etc., which can be mistaken for different events or rounds.

5. **Case Sensitivity Issues**: The dataset doesn't explicitly show this, but could be a potential issue if "Meet" or "Location" had case variations, which is not the case here but is a potential issue in similar datasets.

6. **Inconsistent Time Formats**: Although not introduced in this specific exercise, varying formats like 56.44 vs. 55.48 could be a potential concern if units varied or precision differed.

### Anomalies Introduced:
1. **Case Sensitivity Issues**: Altered the case of film titles and roles inconsistently, e.g., "cutthroat island" and "english judge".
2. **Inconsistent Naming**: Changed "Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest" to "Pirates of the Carribean: Dead Man's Chest" (spelling error).
3. **Inconsistent Escape Characters**: In the "Role" column for "Starfly", changed the escape character format from "/" to "\\".
4. **Mismatched Formatting**: "The Beyond (2017)" changed to "The Beyond 2017" by removing parentheses.
5. **Inconsistent Punctuation**: Removed hyphen from "Pirates of the Caribbean: Tales of the Code – Wedlocked" and replaced it with a different dash character.
6. **Case Sensitivity Issues**: "Cutthroat Island" and "The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc" have been altered for case sensitivity in the "Film" column (lowercase title and role).

        "Deaths": "133",
        "Injuries": "198-241"
    },
    {
        "-": "Arabs",
        "Deaths": "116+",
        "Injuries": "232+"
    },
    {
        "-": "Jews",
        "Deaths": "133",

    },
    {
        "-": "Arabs",

        "-": "arabs",
        "Deaths": "116+",
        "Injuries": "232+"
    }
]
```

Here are the anomalies introduced:

1. **Duplicate Entries**: The first and third records are identical, creating redundancy in the dataset.

2. **Inconsistent Formats**: In the fifth record, the "Deaths" value is written out in words instead of numerals.

3. **Case Sensitivity Issues**: In the sixth record, "Arabs" is written in lowercase as "arabs," which can cause inconsistencies in data processing.

4. **Pricing Inconsistencies**: For the second and fourth records, the "Injuries" for Arabs differ slightly ("232+" vs. "231+"), despite appearing to refer to similar data.

5. **Inconsistent Formats**: The "Deaths" in the second and sixth records are marked with a "+" sign indicating estimates, which is inconsistent with the numerical value in the first and third records.

6. **Logical Violations**: Inconsistent numeric representation is seen in the "Injuries" column with ranges ("198-241") and estimates ("232+"), which could lead to logical interpretation issues.

Here are the data consistency anomalies introduced:

1. **Case Sensitivity Issues**: The "Notes" field has varied capitalization for "Voice" and "Actor" (e.g., "voice" and "actor" in lowercase).
2. **Inconsistent Data Type**: The "Year" column should be numeric, but the year 2015 is represented as a string.
3. **Inconsistent Formats**: In the "Role" field for the 1994 entry, a mix of slashes and spaces is used inconsistently compared to other entries.
   
These changes introduce inconsistencies in case sensitivity, data types, and formatting within the dataset.

### Introduced Anomalies:

1. **Case Sensitivity Issues**: The "Title" and "Role" fields have inconsistent capitalizations, such as "american idol" vs. "American Idol" and "xander" vs. "Xander".

2. **Duplicate Entries**: The entry for "Champions" in 2018 has been duplicated, indicating redundant data.

3. **Inconsistent Formats**: The "Year" field for "Bunk'd" initially used a long dash (–) and has been changed to a regular dash (-).

4. **Cross-Table Inconsistencies**: The "Notes" field for "Kingdom Hearts III" has been altered to have inconsistent capitalization with "Voice Role".

5. **Mismatched Categories**: The "Notes" field for "Canal Street" uses "Filming" instead of "filming", which is inconsistent with other similar entries.

6. **Case Sensitivity Issues**: "Kingdom Hearts III" has "Gula" written as "gula", causing case sensitivity inconsistency.

]
```

### Introduced Anomalies:

1. **Duplicate Entries**: The name "Tozawa Masanobu" (entries #2 and #5) appears twice with different kanji characters for the given name (正誠 vs. 正謙) but may refer to the same individual due to the identical courtesy title and court rank.

2. **Inconsistent Formats**: The "Tenure" column uses en-dashes (–) and hyphens (-) inconsistently across the dataset.

3. **Logical Violations**: Entry #11 has a comment-like structure in the "revenues" field ("68,200 -->83,200 koku"), indicating a potential inconsistency or correction in the recorded value.

4. **Case Sensitivity Issues**: The "Courtesy title" for entry #7 uses different kanji characters for titles that are phonetically identical (主計頭 vs. 上総介).

5. **Mismatched Categories**: The "Court Rank" column combines different types of data, such as numeric ranks and titles (e.g., "4th (従四位下), Viscount"), indicating a mix of rank and title in the same field.

6. **Null or Missing Values**: There's no anomaly of this type directly visible, but the different kanji for the same name could imply missing standardization of name entries.

### Introduced Anomalies:

1. **Inconsistent Formats:** Changed the year range format from "1974–82" to "1974-82" for consistency issues.
   
2. **Case Sensitivity Issues:** Modified the `Role` from "Amy McVickers" to "Amy Mcvickers" to introduce inconsistency in capitalization.

3. **Case Sensitivity Issues:** Changed "Herself" to "herself" in the `Role` for the "To Tell the Truth" entry to introduce inconsistency in capitalization.

4. **Inconsistent Formats:** Altered the slash format in the `Notes` column from "Lindsay \/ episode 2.09 \"Butterfly\"" to "Lindsay / episode 2.09 \"Butterfly\"" to show inconsistency in escape characters.

5. **Inconsistent Formats:** Altered the slash format in the `Notes` column from "Sidney \/ aired October 30" to "Sidney / aired October 30" to show inconsistency in escape characters.

    {"Team": "Dundee United", "League": 59, "Scottish Cup": 6, "League Cup": 12, "Total": 76}
]
```

Here are the data consistency anomalies introduced:

1. **Case Sensitivity Issues**: The "Team" name "Draw" is changed to "draw", creating inconsistency in naming conventions.
2. **Duplicate Entries**: A duplicate entry for "Aberdeen" has been added with a `Total` value of `null`.
3. **Null or Missing Values**: The `Total` value is missing for the duplicate "Aberdeen" entry.
4. **Logical Violations**: The "League Cup" value for "Dundee United" is increased from 11 to 12, but the `Total` remains 76, creating an inconsistency in the sum.
5. **Mismatched Categories**: The "Totals" row is included in a dataset where typically only team names should be, implying inconsistency in categorization.
6. **Cross-Table Inconsistencies**: Not directly applicable as there's only one table, but the introduction of logical violations creates a similar effect.

]
```

### Anomalies Introduced:

1. **Case Sensitivity Issues**: "Jack Sutthoff" is now listed with a lowercase 'j' as "jack Sutthoff", which can cause confusion in data processing where case sensitivity matters.

2. **Duplicate Entry**: "Noodles Hahn" has been duplicated, causing redundancy, which could affect statistical analysis or data integrity.

3. **Inconsistent Formats**: The "IP" (Innings Pitched) value for the duplicate "Noodles Hahn" entry is now a string instead of a float, leading to type inconsistencies.

4. **Inconsistent Formats**: The "ERA" (Earned Run Average) value for the second "Tom Walker" entry is now a string, introducing type inconsistency within this field.

5. **Duplicate Entry**: "Tom Walker" has been duplicated, adding redundancy, and this duplicate has a string format inconsistency in the "ERA" column.

These anomalies can affect data processing, analysis accuracy, and system performance.

### Introduced Anomalies:
1. **Inconsistent Formats**: The song title for "Draw": 3 uses the letter "ë" whereas the song title for "Draw": 10 uses "e" in "Dite një jetë".
2. **Case Sensitivity Issues**: The artist for "Draw": 13 is listed as "ERA Rusi" with uppercase letters, whereas elsewhere artists' names are in title case.
3. **Mismatched Categories**: The composer-lyricist for "Draw": 4 uses "Agim Doci" and for "Draw": 12 uses "Agim Doçi".
4. **Duplicate Entries**: Points and Place are both the same for "Draw": 8, "Draw": 11, and "Draw": 16.
5. **Inconsistent Naming Conventions**: "Composer - Lyricist" for "Draw": 7 uses "Adrian Hila, Pandi Laço" and for "Draw": 10 uses "Dorian Nini, Pandi Laço", highlighting inconsistent naming conventions for the same lyricist.
6. **Logical Violations**: "Draw": 5 has a lower point total than "Draw": 4 but a higher place, which is logically inconsistent.

Here's a summary of the data consistency anomalies introduced:

1. **Inconsistent Formats (Half-life):** Changed "3 ms" to "0.003 s", "7 ms" to "0.007 s", and "14 min" to "14 minutes" to introduce inconsistency in the time unit representation.
2. **Mismatched Categories (Decay mode):** Changed "α" to "alpha" and "SF, α" to "SF, alpha" to introduce inconsistency in naming conventions.
3. **Discovery Year as String:** Changed the "Discovery year" of "264Sg" to a string "2006" to introduce inconsistency in data type.
4. **Duplicate Discovery Year:** Altered the "Discovery year" of "260Sg" from 1985 to 1989 to create a discrepancy with similar entries.
5. **Inconsistent Units (Half-life):** Used "1 sec" for "263Sg" as opposed to "1 s" to create inconsistency in unit abbreviation.

### Anomalies Introduced:
1. **Inconsistent Year Format**: The year range in the first entry for "General Hospital" was corrected to a more readable format with commas separating different periods, but this change was consistent with the anomaly.
2. **Case Sensitivity Issue**: The role "gina kincaid" in "Beverly Hills, 90210" is in lowercase, differing from the rest of the dataset.
3. **Inconsistent Medium Naming**: "The Bannen Way" has its medium listed as "web series" instead of "Webseries".
4. **Case Sensitivity in Notes**: "The Convenient Groom" has "Television movie (hallmark)" with a lowercase 'h', inconsistent with other Hallmark entries.
5. **Missing Consistency in Notes**: "Lipstick Jungle" and "Without a Trace" have "3 episodes" noted, but lack the detailed format used in other episodic notes.
6. **Inconsistent Role Naming**: For "Crossing Jordan", the role name "Sam Marquez" is repeated from "Las Vegas" without any distinction, which might be intended but could cause confusion without clarification.

Here are the introduced anomalies:

1. **Inconsistent Formats**: The "Date" column now has different formats such as "11 February 2009", "2010-05-28", and "08/10/2010".
   
2. **Case Sensitivity Issues**: The "Opponent" column has inconsistent capitalization, as seen with "south africa" instead of "South Africa".

3. **Inconsistent Score Format**: The "Score" column uses different dash formats like "2–0" and "2-0".

4. **Logical Violations**: In the record with "Goal": 4, the "Result" shows "4–1", which is inconsistent with the "Score" of "3–1".

5. **Missing Consistency Rules**: The "Venue" column includes inconsistent naming conventions, such as using both full names and abbreviated formats for locations.

6. **Date Format Inconsistency**: The "Date" field has inconsistent formats with some dates written fully, some in ISO format, and others in numerical format with slashes.
