Anomalies Introduced:
1. **Overlapping Times**: "Kath & Kim" now appears to span from 2010 back to 2009.
2. **Logical Violations**: "True Blood" is listed with a year range that begins and ends in 2010, suggesting a possible repetitive or redundant entry.
3. **Invalid Sequence**: "The Hot Housewives of Orlando" appears with a backward time range from 2014 to 2010.
4. **Extreme Outliers**: "Black Monday" has a future year of 2025, which is beyond the current data set timeline.
5. **Inconsistent Time Zones**: "The Big Bang Theory" has been updated to start from 2010, potentially conflicting with existing records.
6. **Ambiguous Time Intervals**: The time range format for "Kath & Kim" is inconsistent with the rest of the dataset.

### Temporal Anomalies Introduced:

1. **Year in the Future**: The year for "Kingdom Hearts III" has been changed from 2019 to 2025, creating a future anomaly as the event is listed to occur beyond the current year (2023).

2. **Logical Violation**: Although not directly visible in this data, the presence of a future year implies that the role has been completed before the game release, which is a logical inconsistency.

The modifications introduce a temporal anomaly by breaking the expected sequence of events and creating an inconsistency with the timeline of game releases and voice acting roles.

    {"Year": 2008, "Competition": "Xiamen International Marathon", "Venue": "Xiamen, China", "Position": "1st", "Notes": "Marathon"}
]
```

Here are the temporal anomalies introduced based on the dataset:

1. **Invalid Sequence**: The "Xiamen International Marathon" entry now has a year of 2008, which is earlier than the previous events listed, creating a sequence anomaly as it appears after events that occurred in later years in the dataset.

2. **Impossible Duration**: The "Xiamen International Marathon" now appears to have occurred before all the Istanbul Marathons listed, which is unlikely considering the structure of typical sequential records for such events.

These modifications introduce logical and sequential inconsistencies that represent temporal anomalies in the dataset.

2. **Invalid Sequence**: "Coco" is shown as being nominated in 2016, which is before its actual release year of 2017, creating a logical violation.

### Explanation of Temporal Anomalies Introduced:

1. **Future Date Anomaly**: The "Year" for the "European Indoor Championships" was changed to 2025, which introduces a future date anomaly since it is beyond the current year 2023.

2. **Overlapping Times**: The year 2016 has three competitions listed, which could imply overlapping events without clear differentiation in dates or months, leading to a potential scheduling conflict.

3. **Impossible Duration**: For the "European Championships" in 2016, the position "1st" with a note of "2.29 m" might conflict temporally with the same note value in the "World Indoor Championships" where the position was "8th", challenging the consistency of performance records across time.

4. **Extreme Outlier**: The "Notes" value "2.29 m" in both 2016 entries (World Indoor and European Championships) could suggest an exceptional outlier if considered in the context of typical performance trends over time.

5. **Logical Violation**: The "Position" of "16th (q)" in the 2016 "Olympic Games" with a "Notes" of "2.26 m" may logically conflict with better performance notes in other competitions, highlighting inconsistencies over time.

6. **Invalid Sequence**: The jump from 2019 back to a future year 2025 (in the adjusted entry) without any data for intervening years suggests an invalid sequence that disrupts the chronological flow.

### Temporal Anomalies Introduced:
1. **Impossible Duration**: The year for "The Wizard of Oz" was changed to 2016, creating an overlap with "Ghost the Musical" in the same year, which is unlikely given the roles.
2. **Invalid Sequence**: The year for "Evita" is corrected to 2018, indicating that the production started the same year as the last listed event, fixing the incomplete year representation.
3. **Overlapping Times**: The overlapping years for "Wicked" in 2014 (two different entries) suggest two productions potentially running simultaneously, which might be logistically complex.
4. **Missing Time Values**: The initial representation of "2018-" for "Evita" was altered to remove an open-ended time frame, enforcing a definitive start.
5. **Incorrect Time Formatting**: The year for "The Wizard of Oz" was previously formatted as "2017–2018" which was simplified to just 2016 for consistency.
6. **Logical Violations**: The years were adjusted to ensure there's no future year beyond the provided dataset context (up to 2023).

I've introduced temporal anomalies by modifying the 'Year' column and adding a negative time value in the 'Notes' column. The changes include:
1. Future year anomaly in 2082.
2. Past year anomaly in 1893.
3. Negative time value of -56.57 in 1998 event.
These changes introduce inconsistencies typical of temporal anomalies.

Here are the temporal anomalies introduced:

1. **Invalid Sequence**: For "Criminal Minds", the end year is missing, creating an open-ended sequence.
2. **Extreme Outlier**: Added a future record for the year 2025 with "Future Show".
3. **Ambiguous Time Intervals**: For "Teen Wolf", the year is set as "2015–2016" instead of using a consistent "2015–16" format.
4. **Logical Violations**: For "NCIS", the year is set as "2014–15", which might cause confusion when paired with "2015–2016" as the sequences seem to overlap.
5. **Missing Time Values**: The "Criminal Minds" entry lacks a clear end year.
6. **Inconsistent Time Zones**: Not applicable directly, but ambiguity in the year formats could imply unaccounted differences.

]
```

Here are the temporal anomalies introduced:

1. **Impossible Duration**: The "World Championships" entry in 2005 has been changed to 1895, which is an impossible year for the competition given modern athletics history.
2. **Overlapping Times**: No overlapping events are introduced as the data does not contain specific times.
3. **Logical Violations**: The year 1895 is logically inconsistent compared to the other years listed, as the World Championships did not exist at that time.
4. **Missing Time Values**: No specific time fields exist in this dataset to introduce missing values.
5. **Extreme Outliers**: The year 1895 is an outlier compared to the other years which are all in the 20th and 21st centuries.
6. **Inconsistent Time Zones**: Not applicable due to lack of time zone data in this dataset.

### Anomalies Introduced:

1. **Impossible Duration**: In the third record, the time "37' 60.01" is introduced. This is an impossible duration since there cannot be 60 seconds in a minute.

2. **Inconsistent Time Formatting**: The time format is inconsistent with the typical hh:mm:ss format as it mixes minutes and seconds without clear delimiters or context for hours. This anomaly is present in all records but highlighted by the anomaly in the third record.

### Temporal Anomalies Introduced:

1. **Overlapping Times**: The year 2025 for "The Years" is set beyond the current year (2023), making it an anomaly as it represents future data.

2. **Logical Violations**: "Nineteen Eighty Seven" was given the year 1987, which is a logical violation within the context of the dataset where other records are in the 21st century.

3. **Extreme Outliers**: The year for "The Years" is set to 2025, which is a significant outlier compared to the other entries centered around the early 2010s.

4. **Invalid Sequence**: Given the context of other years, the year 1987 for "Nineteen Eighty Seven" seems out of chronological sequence, as it appears to move backwards compared to the other entries.

The anomalies illustrate how temporal data can be manipulated to create inconsistencies and errors in datasets.

### Anomalies Introduced:
1. **Overlapping Times**: Changed the date of "Deep: clubDeep Tokyo: Future King Tournament 2006" from December 9, 2006, to December 19, 2006, causing an overlap with "Deep: 27 Impact" on December 20, 2006.

2. **Impossible Durations**: Changed the year of "Deep: 26 Impact" from 2006 to 2007, making it appear to occur after a later event in the original sequence.

3. **Logical Violations**: Altered the date of "Deep: 23 Impact" from February 5, 2006, to February 5, 2005, making it appear before "Deep: 24 Impact."

These modifications introduce realistic temporal anomalies that might occur in event scheduling and data recording.

### Temporal Anomalies Introduced:

1. **Impossible Duration**: The year "2000-1999" for "The West Wing" indicates a period that ends before it starts.
   
2. **Overlapping Times**: The year "1981" for both "Word of Honor" and "Miracle on Ice" suggests they could have been produced or aired simultaneously, which could be a scheduling conflict if both were significant roles requiring the actor's presence.

3. **Invalid Sequence**: The entry for "The West Wing" has an invalid sequence because the year "2000-1999" logically suggests a negative timeline.

4. **Ambiguous Time Interval**: The year "1972-1977" for "The Streets of San Francisco" suggests a range but without clear start and end points, complicating the understanding of the timeline, particularly if more context is needed.

5. **Logical Violation**: The year "2000-1999" for "The West Wing" also implies a logical violation as the start year is after the end year.

6. **Extreme Outliers**: The anomaly in "The West Wing" where it is listed as "2000-1999" might be seen as an extreme outlier because such a reversal of years is highly unusual and logically impossible.

]
```

### Temporal Anomalies Introduced:
1. **Inconsistent Time Zones**: Changed "Budapest, Romania" to "Budapest, Hungary" for consistency. However, left the time zone change unaccounted between "Genoa, Italy" and "Budapest, Hungary" for potential time zone difference issues.
2. **Invalid Sequence**: Changed the year of the "Triple jump" event from 1992 to 1989, making it occur before the "Long jump" event in the same venue, even though logically they should be in the same year since they are the same competition.
3. **Logical Violations**: Changed "European Indoor Championships" in 1992 to "European Championships" to reflect a possible mistake in event naming that suggests an outdoor event occurred at the same time as an indoor event.
4. **Venue Mismatch**: Used a venue ("Genoa, Italy") for "European Championships" which traditionally might not host such events, indicating a potential scheduling error or venue misallocation.
5. **Overlapping Times**: The change in "Triple jump" year to 1989 implies the same competition year had two different events, creating an overlap with other events that could logically be spaced out.
6. **Missing Time Values**: In the notes of the last entry, altered the representation to show inconsistency or ambiguity in the measurement unit (missing "m" for meters in "13.02").

Here are the temporal anomalies introduced:

1. **Future Year:** The year for the first entry was changed from 1992 to 2025, introducing a future date anomaly as it is beyond the current year (2023).
2. **Inconsistent Year for Nominee:** The nominee "1916" is an album by Motörhead released in 1991, but the original year was set to 1992, now changed to 2025, creating a temporal inconsistency with the release timeframe. 

These anomalies disrupt the logical consistency of the dataset.

I introduced the following temporal anomalies:

1. **Logical Violation**: Replaced the year in one entry with a non-numeric string ("Dance Educators of America") which violates logical expectations for the "Year" column.

2. **Future Date Anomaly**: Changed the Year for the Primetime Emmy Award for "Celine in Las Vegas: Opening Night Live" from 2003 to 2025, introducing a year in the future.

### Temporal Anomalies Introduced:
1. **Future Event**: Changed the year for the "World Championships" in Beijing, China from 2015 to 2025, creating an anomaly of having a future event that hasn't occurred yet.
2. **Impossible Duration**: No changes made here, but if there were start and end times, they could be inconsistent with the Notes time.
3. **Inconsistent Time Zones**: No explicit time zone data to manipulate, but if it were present, event times could be shifted to create inconsistencies.
4. **Invalid Sequence**: An event from the future (2025) is listed among past events, creating a logical inconsistency in event sequencing.
5. **Overlapping Times**: Overlaps in event times are not applicable here as only the year is provided, not specific start and end times.
6. **Extreme Outliers**: No changes made here, but implausible performance times could be introduced if necessary.

Note: The dataset primarily involves years; thus, some temporal anomalies like overlapping times or missing time values are less applicable. The focus was on creating future and sequencing anomalies.

### Temporal Anomalies Introduced:
1. **Impossible Duration:** "Music in the Air" has an end year before the start year (2009-2008).
2. **Invalid Sequence:** "The Phantom of the Opera" at the Venetian Resort and Casino has a start year after the end year (2006-2005).
3. **Invalid Sequence:** "Master Class" also has a start year after the end year (2011-2010).
4. **Impossible Duration:** "The Age of Innocence" has an end year before the start year (2018-2017).
5. **Logical Violation:** "Love Never Dies" has a year span formatted correctly, but an earlier event than a later one logically (2010-2011).
6. **Correct Sequence Misrepresentation:** "Les Miserables" and "The Little Mermaid" entries remain consistent but illustrate how properly formatted sequences should appear in contrast to anomalies.

**Temporal Anomalies Introduced:**

1. **Overlapping Times:** None explicitly introduced as the dataset does not contain start and end times for events.
2. **Impossible Durations:** None applicable directly as the dataset does not contain durations.
3. **Logical Violations:** None applicable directly as there are no logical constraints between the fields that involve time sequencing.
4. **Extreme Outliers:** Changed the Year of the last entry from 2017 to 2025, making it an outlier compared to the rest of the dataset.
5. **Inconsistent Time Zones:** None applicable as the dataset does not involve time zones.
6. **Invalid Sequence:** None applicable directly as the dataset does not contain sequential events with a dependency.
7. **Missing Time Values:** None applicable directly as all Year values are present.
8. **Incorrect Time Formatting:** None applicable as the Year values are correctly formatted.
9. **Ambiguous Time Intervals:** None applicable as the Year values are clear and not intervals.
10. **Other Temporal Anomalies:** None introduced beyond the extreme outlier Year change.

```

Anomalies Introduced:
1. **Year Overlap**: The "Olympic Games" event is moved from 2016 to 2020, creating an overlap with the existing timeline, as the next Olympics should have been in 2020, but the data does not reflect the occurrence of the event in 2016.
2. **Logical Violation**: The "Olympic Games" in 2020 were actually postponed to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but the dataset reflects it as occurring in 2020.
3. **Extreme Outlier**: The "Position" for the "Olympic Games" in 2020 is kept as "25th (q)" despite the event's significant global impact and changes, which is unusual for a major games anomaly.
4. **Invalid Sequence**: The sequence of years does not follow the typical chronological order expected in a dataset without the anomaly of the 2020 Olympics.
5. **Missing Time Values**: There is no entry for the year 2012, which would normally include a major competition like the Olympics, creating a temporal gap.
6. **Inconsistent Time Zones**: The original dataset does not account for the time zone differences in the "Venue" information, but this anomaly isn't directly visible in the dataset.

**Temporal Anomalies Introduced:**
1. **Overlapping Times**: None explicitly introduced as overlap isn't applicable directly to the "Year" column in this context.
2. **Impossible Durations**: Adjusted the "Year" for "Best Sleeve Design" to 2015, which may imply an event that didn't fit the original sequence.
3. **Logical Violations**: The "Lyricist of the Year" prize is now set to 2012, which creates a logical inconsistency if all awards were supposed to be in 2014.
4. **Extreme Outliers**: None introduced as "Year" values do not exhibit extreme outliers.
5. **Inconsistent Time Zones**: Not directly applicable to "Year", but creating a sequence inconsistency can imply timezone mishandling in a broader context.
6. **Invalid Sequence**: The sequence of awards does not align to a logical progression (e.g., a 2012 award appears after a 2014 award).
7. **Missing Time Values**: Not directly applicable as no entries have been removed.
8. **Incorrect Time Formatting**: None introduced; "Year" values are consistently formatted.
9. **Ambiguous Time Intervals**: None introduced; "Year" values are clearly specified.
10. **Other Temporal Anomalies**: Introduced a logical inconsistency by changing years that break the expected chronological order of the dataset.

``` 

### Temporal Anomalies Introduced:

1. **Inconsistent Time Frame:** The entry for `"Mikraj Cinta"` has been changed from 2016 to 2015, which may not align with other records from the same ceremony year.

2. **Future Date:** The entry for `"Unplugged"` under the category "Best Album" has been changed to the year 2020, which is beyond the documented data year of 2016.

3. **Past Date:** The entry for `"Menatap dalam Mimpi"` under the category "Best Pop Song" has been changed to the year 2017, creating a future reference from the original 2016 entries.

4. **Inconsistent Year Sequence:** The mixed years (2015, 2016, 2017, 2020) for awards that were originally all in 2016 introduce logical inconsistencies.

These adjustments introduce temporal anomalies that could affect analyses or interpretations based on the assumption that all events occurred in the same year.

In this modified dataset, the following temporal anomalies have been introduced:

1. **Overlapping Times**: The record for the 2009 World Championships 4 x 400 m relay event has been duplicated with a different time value, suggesting overlapping results.
2. **Impossible Durations**: The "Commonwealth Games" 4 x 400 m relay event in 2002 shows an impossible duration of "34:31.50", which is not feasible for a 4 x 400 m relay.
3. **Logical Violations**: In 2010, an anomalous duplicate entry appears with the same event and position but with a different year format as a string "2010".
4. **Extreme Outliers**: The 2002 "Commonwealth Games" 4 x 400 m relay time is far beyond typical competitive relay times.
5. **Invalid Sequence**: The 2009 World Championships 4 x 400 m relay is listed twice in a way that could imply an invalid sequence or duplicated event.
6. **Inconsistent Time Formats**: Throughout the dataset, times are displayed in inconsistent formats, such as mixed numeric and string representations, reflecting potential formatting issues.

Anomalies introduced:
1. **Invalid Sequence**: The "Neighbours" entry has an invalid time range "2007-2003", making it appear as though the series ran backwards in time.
2. **Future Outlier**: The "Liars All" entry has been changed to 2025, a future date, which is inconsistent with the rest of the dataset.
3. **Incorrect Time Formatting**: The "Neighbours" entry uses a reversed date range format "2007-2003" instead of the correct chronological order.

### Temporal Anomalies Introduced
1. **Future Date:** Changed the year for the nomination of "\"The Metre\"" from 2002 to 2025, creating a future event.
2. **Extreme Outlier:** The year 2025 for a nomination is an implausibly future date given the context of other awards in 2001.
3. **Invalid Sequence:** Having a nomination in 2025 creates a sequence issue as it jumps multiple years forward without intermediate nominations.

Anomalies introduced:
1. Swapped the years of the 1981 and 1983 CAC Championships events to create an invalid sequence.
2. Adjusted the year of the 1981 "100 m" event to 1983, creating a logical violation where an event result is recorded before its occurrence.
3. Corrected the year of the 1983 "4x100 m relay" event to 1982, causing an overlap with the Commonwealth Games held in the same year.
4. Introduced a logical impossibility by making the year of the 1982 "4x100 m relay" event earlier than the "100 m" event of the same competition.
5. Modified the year of the 1979 "Pan American Games" to 1980, creating a chronological inconsistency with the Olympic Games in the same year.

### Temporal Anomalies Introduced:
1. **Overlapping Times**: The 2015 entries now all overlap in the same year, potentially indicating scheduling conflicts for events typically held in different years.
2. **Invalid Sequence**: The "South American U23 Championships" entry was moved to 2016, despite occurring before events in 2015, creating a sequence issue.
3. **Missing Time Values**: The "World Indoor Championships" and "Ibero-American Championships" were both moved to 2015, with no clear distinction on when these happened within that year, causing ambiguity.
4. **Extreme Outliers**: The "World Junior Championships" entry for 2010 with a note of 13.79 is suspiciously fast for its category.
5. **Inconsistent Time Zones**: The venues are globally dispersed, but the dataset does not account for potential time zone differences that could affect event timings.
6. **Logical Violations**: The 2011 "South American Junior Championships" events occur in the same location back-to-back but do not specify exact timing, which could logically overlap.

Here are the temporal anomalies introduced:

1. **Future Date Anomaly**: The entry for "Girls" now has the year 2025, which is in the future relative to the data context (up to 2023).

2. **Invalid Sequence**: The entry for "Nature Cat" spans "2015–present". Introducing a future year for "Girls" creates a sequence anomaly since "Girls" is now listed in 2025, conflicting with the "present" which should logically be up to 2023.

These changes demonstrate the introduction of temporal anomalies within the given dataset.

### Temporal Anomalies Introduced:
1. **Overlapping Times**: Changed the year from 2017 to 2023 for the record with host Bence Istenes, causing an overlap with real-world future expectations as events are usually not planned that far ahead.
2. **Logical Violations**: The year 2023 for the event with Bence Istenes creates a logical violation, as it conflicts with current data knowledge that the event hasn't occurred yet.
3. **Extreme Outliers**: The year 2023 is an extreme outlier compared to the other years in the dataset.
4. **Invalid Sequence**: The sequence of events suggests an invalid progression (jumping from 2004 to 2023 and then back to 2018), creating a temporal inconsistency.
5. **Missing Time Values**: There's an implicit expectation for a continuous timeline or logical progression of years, which is disrupted by the inserted future year.
6. **Ambiguous Time Intervals**: The year 2023 creates an ambiguous time interval regarding when the event could have taken place, given the existing context of the dataset.

I have introduced a temporal anomaly by changing the year of the last entry from 1985 to 1983, creating an impossible duration anomaly where an award is recorded before the rest of the events in 1984.

### Temporal Anomalies Introduced:

1. **Overlapping Times**: Changed the year of the "MTV Video Music Awards Latin America" from 2007 to 2008 to create an overlap with the subsequent awards in 2007.
   
2. **Impossible Durations**: Adjusted the year of "OVMALA" for "Best Costume in a Video (Women)" from 2007 to 2009, making it anomalous if these were supposed to be evaluated in the same period.

3. **Invalid Sequence**: Changed the year of the "OVMALA" award for "Best Female Video" from 2007 to 2005, making it appear awarded before other awards that should logically occur first.

### Temporal Anomalies Introduced:

1. **Overlapping Times & Invalid Sequence**:
   - Swapped the years for "Hellos and Goodbyes (Live)" and "On a Mission" to create an anomaly where the live album "Hellos and Goodbyes (Live)" is released in 2001, but "On a Mission" is released earlier in 2000, despite potentially depending on the outcome of the live album.

2. **Impossible Durations**:
   - "Water in My Head" remains released in 1996, but the implication is that it could not have been produced or released in the same timeframe as other events, which creates a logical inconsistency if considered in a broader context of event production.

3. **Extreme Outliers**:
   - No change needed here as the years span an acceptable range, but the sudden jump from 2001 to 2007 without releases could be considered an anomaly in terms of production consistency.

4. **Logical Violations**:
   - The year 2001 for "Hellos and Goodbyes (Live)" suggests it might have been recorded after "On a Mission" even though it was logically released earlier, thus creating a potential chronological inconsistency.

5. **Missing Time Values**:
   - All records have a year, so no missing values were introduced, but the gap in years between 2001 and 2007 could imply missing releases in the dataset.

6. **Ambiguous Time Intervals**:
   - The swap of years for "Hellos and Goodbyes (Live)" and "On a Mission" creates ambiguity about the chronological order of the albums' releases and the progression of the artist's work.

Anomalies introduced:
1. **Overlapping Times**: Changed the year for "What's up YO!" to end in 2005, causing an overlap with "Infinite Challenge" which starts in 2005.
2. **Impossible Duration**: Adjusted "2006–08" in "Music Bank" to "2006–02", making it impossible since it supposedly ends before it starts.
3. **Logical Violations**: Extended "Infinite Challenge" to "2005–23", which suggests continuation beyond the current date.
4. **Invalid Sequence**: "How Are You.MOV" ends in "2018–19", suggesting it ends after 2018, yet the note says "present".
5. **Extreme Outliers**: No extreme outliers are applicable due to the nature of the dataset.
6. **Inconsistent Time Zones**: No explicit time zones are involved in this dataset.

]
```

Here are the temporal anomalies introduced:

1. **Overlapping Times**: "Indonesian Idol Season 8" appears in both 2014 and 2013, suggesting a scheduling conflict or overlap.
   
2. **Impossible Durations**: "Rising Star Indonesia" is listed in 2014 and then again in 2016, which might suggest an implausible duration for the same role within the same title context.

3. **Logical Violations**: "Hijab Traveler" initially listed in 2017 and then shifted earlier to 2015, which could imply a logical violation if the content depends on a chronological sequence.

4. **Extreme Outliers**: "Hijab Traveler" is further modified to appear in 2020, which may be an outlier given the context of other roles listed closer to 2014.

5. **Invalid Sequence**: By having the same title and role appear in non-sequential years (e.g., "Indonesian Idol Season 8" in 2013 and 2014), an invalid sequence is introduced.

6. **Missing Time Values**: The dataset doesn't have missing time values, but the modification creates a scenario where the sequence continuity is disrupted, simulating a conceptual "missing" logical timeline.

```

### Explanation of Anomalies:

1. **Overlapping Times**: The "JAG" entry has a year range "1998-1999", which overlaps with other entries from 1999.
   
2. **Invalid Sequence**: The "Frasier" entry is marked with the year 2005, which is after a later entry in the list, suggesting a logical error in sequence.

3. **Extreme Outlier**: The "Firestarter: Rekindled" entry has an implausible year set to 2023, which is far beyond the typical range of years in the dataset.

4. **Missing Time Values**: The "Close to Home" entry has a `null` value for the year, suggesting an incomplete temporal record.

]
```

### Temporal Anomalies Introduced:

1. **Overlapping Times**: The "HMS LCE-14" is marked as sunk on "3 July 1943", while it was being transported on "City of Venice", which sunk the following day on "4 July 1943". This creates a temporal overlap where the transport supposedly sunk before the vessel carrying it did.

2. **Logical Violations**: The sinking date of "HMS LCE-14" appears before the sinking date of "City of Venice", suggesting a logical inconsistency since the transport should not sink before the vessel it is being transported on.

No other temporal anomalies such as impossible durations, extreme outliers, or inconsistent time zones are applicable given the dataset's structure and contents. The primary focus was on logical sequencing and overlaps based on the provided data.

### Introduced Temporal Anomalies:
1. **Overlapping Times**: Changed "The First" from 2018 to "2015-2018" to overlap with the start of "Sorry for Your Loss" in 2018.
2. **Impossible Durations**: No changes made as there are no start and end times.
3. **Logical Violations**: No logical violations are introduced as the data predominantly contains single-year entries or ranges.
4. **Extreme Outliers**: No extreme outliers were introduced as the data focuses on logical time spans for TV series and films.
5. **Invalid Sequence**: No out-of-sequence records are introduced that would affect integrity.
6. **Missing Time Values**: No changes made regarding missing values, as all entries have a year or range.
7. **Incorrect Time Formatting**: No changes made as all years are consistently formatted as four-digit numbers.
8. **Ambiguous Time Intervals**: Already present in the form of year ranges like "1997-2003" and "2009-2011" without specifying specific start or end years within those ranges.

```

**Explanation of Temporal Anomalies Introduced:**

1. **Overlapping Times:** No direct overlap since the dataset is based on years, but the same year is used for two different titles ("Hot Fuzz" and "Elizabeth: The Golden Age") which could indicate a potential scheduling conflict if these were events.

2. **Impossible Durations:** N/A, as the dataset does not contain start and end times.

3. **Logical Violations:** No direct logical violations with the available data.

4. **Extreme Outliers:** The year 2010 for "Nowhere Boy" suggests a future anomaly given the context of the dataset. It is recorded later than the actual release year.

5. **Inconsistent Time Zones:** N/A, as there are no time zones specified.

6. **Invalid Sequence:** Adjusted "Nowhere Boy" to 2010, which could imply a future release error in terms of sequence, assuming a gap in the sequence needs explanation.

7. **Missing Time Values:** N/A, all years are filled.

8. **Incorrect Time Formatting:** N/A, as all year formats are consistent.

9. **Ambiguous Time Intervals:** N/A, as the data does not specify intervals.

10. **Other Temporal Anomalies:** The anomaly in "Nowhere Boy" with the year 2010 being an outlier in terms of the actual release date.

**Anomalies introduced:**

1. **Overlapping Times:** The year for the "Battle of Hazir" was changed from 637 to 634 December, creating an overlap with other battles in the same year.
2. **Impossible Durations:** The "Battle of Bosra" spans June to July within the same entry, which could indicate an anomaly if battles were typically of short duration.
3. **Invalid Sequence:** The "Battle of Hazir" is now dated before the "Battle of Iron Bridge," although it historically occurred afterward.
4. **Extreme Outliers:** The "Battle of Bosra" is noted as taking place over a month, which may be unusually long for a battle in the dataset.
5. **Inconsistent Time Zones:** No explicit time zones are noted, but the overlapping and extended entries imply possible inconsistencies.
6. **Ambiguous Time Intervals:** The "Battle of Bosra" is labeled as "June–July" without specific dates, making it unclear if the battle was continuous or intermittent.

]
```

### Temporal Anomalies Introduced:

1. **Invalid Sequence**: The release date for "Big Towne, 2061" has been set to "December 1975", which is before the release of "Paris" in "January 1976". This creates a temporal inconsistency where an album is released earlier than another despite being listed later in the dataset.

]
```

Here are the temporal anomalies introduced:

1. **Overlapping Times**: The "Peppa Pig" entry spans from 2009 to "present", overlapping with other entries without a clear end year.
   
2. **Logical Violations**: The "How I Live Now" entry originally had a year of 2013, but it was changed to 2015, creating a logical inconsistency if this work was part of a timeline that requires it to be before or after certain events.

3. **Extreme Outliers**: None applied in this dataset, as there are no race times or similar data.

4. **Inconsistent Time Zones**: None applied, as this dataset does not involve time zones.

5. **Invalid Sequence**: None applied, as the sequence of years is mostly preserved except for possible logical violations.

6. **Missing Time Values**: None applied, as all records have some kind of year value.

7. **Incorrect Time Formatting**: None applied, as all year formats are consistent.

8. **Ambiguous Time Intervals**: The "Peppa Pig" entry with the year "2009\u2013present" could be considered ambiguous without a clear end year.

9. **Other Temporal Anomalies**: None applied beyond those listed.
