Explanation of Anomalies:
1. **Contradiction**: In 1994, the "American Music Awards of 1994" shows two different results for the same work and category.
2. **Unrealistic Category**: In 1995, "Bacdafucup" is listed under the "Best Rock Album" category at the Grammy Awards, which is not typical for a rap album.
3. **Chronological Inconsistency**: The album "Bacdafucup" is shown to win an award in 1993 at the MTV Video Music Awards, which is a year before its real award entries.
4. **Misaligned Category**: In 1992, "Bacdafucup" is nominated for a "Top Dance Album" at the Billboard Music Awards, which is inconsistent with its genre.
5. **Chronological Discrepancy**: "Bacdafucup" is shown to win a "Rap/Hip-Hop New Artist" award in 1996, which is four years after its release.

1. **Contradiction:** Changed the role in "Dallas" (2013) to "Cally Harper" from "Cally Harper Ewing", as it inconsistently matches with the earlier entries where she was a main cast.
2. **Unrealistic Values:** In "Walker, Texas Ranger", changed the role to "Audrey 'Candy Delight' Forrester", suggesting an unusual character name for the context of the show.
3. **Ambiguity:** In "Beverly Hills, 90210", added dual role "Ginger O'Hara / Marla Crawford", creating ambiguity about which character was played.
4. **Contextual Discrepancy:** For "Dallas" (1988-91), the note states "Main cast (70 episodes)", which is excessive compared to typical roles played over three years in such series.
5. **Misaligned Benchmarks:** No changes made, as other potential misalignments are minimal or absent.
6. **Other Anomalies:** No additional anomalies added, as the dataset is limited to a specific structure without numerical data or geographical references.

]
```

Here are the factual anomalies introduced:

1. **Unrealistic Values**: The number of applicants in 2013 is adjusted to "2,129", which is higher than the actual number of admits in any given year, contradicting the typical trend where admits are a smaller subset of applicants.

2. **Contradiction**: The percentage admitted in 2014 is 30.1%, which does not match the number of admits and applicants for that year, as it should logically be a smaller number.

3. **Record-Breaking Claims**: The percentage admitted in 2016 is set at 28.6%, which is unusually high given the context, as it suggests an exceptionally high acceptance rate compared to similar competitive institutions.

4. **Misaligned Benchmarks**: The admits in 2013 are recorded as 492, which does not align with the given percentage admitted and the number of applicants for the same year.

5. **Contextual Discrepancies**: The number of applicants in 2012 is set to "2,675", which is a sudden drop from previous years, creating an unexplained trend reversal.

6. **Ambiguity**: The value for applicants in 2016 is given as a string "1,901" instead of a numerical format, which creates ambiguity in data representation.

Here are the factual anomalies imparted:

1. **Contradiction**: The "Doll No. 639" entry notes it won an award for "Best Short Film," yet the modified note claims it received an award for "Best Long Film."

2. **Unrealistic Values**: None specifically applied here due to the nature of the dataset.

3. **Geographical Mismatches**: Not applicable to this dataset.

4. **Ambiguity**: The note for "Doll No. 639" now ambiguously mixes awards for both short and long films, creating confusion about the actual category.

5. **Record-Breaking Claims**: Not applicable to this dataset.

6. **Unlikely Proportions**: Not applicable to this dataset. 

Focusing on creating contradictions and ambiguity was more applicable based on the dataset's structure and context.

```

Here are the factual anomalies introduced into the dataset:

1. **Contradiction**: The "Casualty" episode in 2018 is now "Series 33, Episode 34," which contradicts the typical episode numbering since it exceeds the usual number of episodes per series.

2. **Unlikely Proportions**: "EastEnders" is noted as having 35 episodes for a series regular role, which is unusually low for a show known for having numerous episodes per year.

3. **Contextual Discrepancies**: "Doctors" in 2019 is marked as a "Recurring role," without specifying the number of episodes, which typically is more detailed in casting notes.

4. **Ambiguity**: The role "Energy Drink Vendor" in "Episodes" lacks context about the significance, which is typically specified for such roles, creating ambiguity.

5. **Unrealistic Values**: "WPC 56" is noted as having "4 episodes," which seems low for a series role, as series typically have more episodes.

6. **Misaligned Benchmarks**: The "Casualty" episode in 2007 is referred to as "Series 22, Episode 6," without a consistent pattern with other entries in the dataset, potentially confusing the series progression context.

Here are the factual anomalies included:

1. **Contradiction**: The entry for "2017 BET Hip Hop Awards" in the "Best Mixtape" category shows "My Moment" as winning, which contradicts the previous result of being nominated.

2. **Record-Breaking Claim**: The "MTV Video Music Awards" entry for 2018 shows "Push Artist of the Year" as won; typically, such an award would be highly competitive, suggesting a break from the norm or record-breaking achievement.

3. **Unlikely Proportion**: In 2020, the "MTV Europe Music Awards" entry states "Best Song" for "My Moment," which is unlikely given the competitive nature of the awards and the typically global section of artists.

4. **Contextual Discrepancy**: The addition of an entry for "2018 BET Hip Hop Awards" in the "Lyricist of the Year" category with a result of "Nominated" suggests an unexpected recognition in a highly skilled category.

5. **Misaligned Benchmarks**: A new entry for the "Grammy Awards" in 2019 for "Best New Artist" showing a result of "Nominated" implies an unexpected alignment with a major accolade.

6. **Excessive Usage**: The 2020 entry for "MTV Europe Music Awards" as "Best Song" implies excessive recognition beyond typical industry norms, given the previous data context.

### Anomalies Introduced:
1. **Contradiction**: Changed the result for the 2017 entry from "Nominated" to "Won," which contradicts the typical progression where a nomination doesn't necessarily result in a win.
2. **Contextual Discrepancy**: Winning in 2017 for the same work that was only nominated in 2016 suggests an unlikely progression without any new work or enhancement noted.
3. **Unrealistic Value**: The "Nominated work" in 2013 being "Self" could imply an unrealistic scenario where the person was recognized for being themselves rather than a specific work.
4. **Ambiguity**: The "Nominated work" listed as "Self" is ambiguous and doesn't provide clear context for the nomination.
5. **Record-Breaking Claims**: Not directly applicable here, but the idea of winning consecutive nominations without changes to the work could be seen as an anomaly.
6. **Misaligned Benchmarks**: The progression from nomination to a win without any new production or enhancement suggests misalignment in award benchmarks.

Anomalies Introduced:
1. Year 2025 for "Kababayan Today" suggests an appearance in the future, which is unlikely given the dataset's timeframe.
2. The role of "Contestant" for "Philippine Fashion Week" in 2014 contradicts the typical role of a model in a fashion week.
3. The role of "Judge" in "Bench Universe: The 2012 Denim & Underwear Show" for 2015 is inconsistent with its original 2012 timeline.
4. The role of "Model" for "I Am Meg: Own the World in Style" in 2012 contradicts the original role of a judge.
5. Duplicate entries for "Bench Universe: The 2012 Denim & Underwear Show" with conflicting roles in different years introduce ambiguity.
6. The "America's Next Top Model (cycle 21)" event is listed in 2014, which is inconsistent with the typical cycle numbering and timing.

### Anomalies Introduced:
1. **Contradiction**: The "Centre Party" now has more seats (120) than the "National Liberal Party" despite having fewer votes, contradicting typical distribution norms.
2. **Unrealistic Seats**: The "Polish Party" now has a seat count (130) that is disproportionate to its vote percentage (2.9%).
3. **Unlikely Proportions**: The "Others" category shows an excessively high seat count (200) for its vote percentage (0.6%).
4. **Excessive Usage**: The voter turnout percentage is set at 177.5%, which exceeds 100% and is unrealistic.
5. **Geographical Mismatch**: The "Registered voters/turnout" entry has an impossible percentage indicating more votes than registered voters.
6. **Misaligned Benchmarks**: The total number of seats (397) does not align with the altered seat counts in the dataset.

```

1. **Unrealistic Year Range**: Changed the last entry's "Year" from "2018-" to an invalid format "2018-".
2. **Ambiguous Year Format**: The entry for "The Wizard of Oz" has a year format "2017–2018", which could be interpreted inconsistently.
3. **Geographical Mismatch**: "Australian Tour" is listed under "The Wizard of Oz" but includes no specific cities, which could lead to confusion.
4. **Contradiction**: The role of "Elphaba standby" in 2008 and 2009 has no designated primary "Elphaba" for those years, which is unusual.
5. **Contextual Discrepancy**: For "Evita" in "Sydney Opera House", the role is "Eva Perón alternate" without mentioning the primary "Eva Perón", which is atypical for a major production.
6. **Inconsistent Location Detail**: The "Wicked" tour in 2011 lists specific cities, while similar entries in 2014 and 2015 list only broader regions without cities, creating inconsistency.

Anomalies introduced:
1. Changed the "Video" resolution for Channel 12.1 from "1080i" to "1080p", which aligns with typical HD resolutions but contradicts the interlaced "i" format originally.
2. Changed the "Video" resolution for Channel 12.3 to "1440p", an unusually high resolution for a 4:3 aspect TV channel.
3. Changed the "Aspect" for Channel 12.4 to "21:9", which is an unusual aspect ratio for standard definition 480i resolution.
4. No postal code or geographical data to introduce mismatches.
5. No monetary or dosage data to introduce unrealistic values.
6. No record-breaking claims applicable in this dataset context.

### Introduced Anomalies:
1. **Record-Breaking Claims**: The "Ibero-American Championships" in 2016 shows a 200 m time of 19.50 and the "Olympic Games" 200 m time is 19.30, both faster than Usain Bolt's world record of 19.19 seconds.
2. **Unrealistic Values**: The "European Championships" 2018 shows a 4 × 400 m relay time of "2:50.00", which is unrealistically fast compared to typical world records.
3. **Contextual Discrepancies**: The 200 m time in the "Ibero-American Championships" and "Olympic Games" are both extraordinarily fast for a non-record-setting position (2nd and 10th respectively).
4. **Geographical Mismatch**: The "Venue" entry for "World Indoor Championships" is listed as "Portland, United States" with unrealistic sprint times for world championships, hinting at potential data entry errors.
5. **Contradiction**: The position "1st" in the 2016 "European Championships" 200 m event with a time of 20.45 seconds, which is slower than the 19.30 seconds recorded in the "Olympic Games" for a lower position.
6. **Misaligned Benchmarks**: The times listed for certain events do not align with known benchmarks or historical trends, especially for the "Olympic Games" and "European Championships".

### Explanation of Factual Anomalies:

1. **Contradiction (Nigeria Entertainment Awards)**:
   - Changed "Results" from "Nominated" to "Won" for the award "Best Music Video of the Year (artist and director)," suggesting a win without supporting changes elsewhere.
  
2. **Unrealistic Values (African Muzik Magazine Awards 2023)**:
   - Introduced a fictional award year "2023" and award description "Song of the Century," which is not a standard category.

3. **Contradiction (African Muzik Magazine Awards)**:
   - Changed "Results" from "Nominated" to "Won" for "Best Dance in a Video," implying an accolade not corroborated by other data.

4. **Ambiguity (MTV Africa Music Awards)**:
   - Changed "Results" from "Nominated" to "Disqualified," which is not a typical result in award nominations, adding ambiguity.

These changes introduce a series of anomalies that would require further verification and investigation in a real-world data scenario.

### Anomalies Introduced:
1. **Portsmouth 1980–81 Season Total:**
   - Changed "Total" from 2 to 3 to create a mismatch in the record.
   
2. **Portsmouth Total League Goals:**
   - Adjusted "League" from 39 to 40 to create a discrepancy between season totals and career totals.

3. **Cardiff City Total League Goals:**
   - Increased "League" from 22 to 23 in the total row for Cardiff City, creating a mismatch with the sum of individual seasons.

4. **Career Total League Goals:**
   - Adjusted "League" from 77 to 78, causing inconsistency with the sum of league goals from all clubs.

These anomalies introduce inconsistencies in goal totals across seasons, club totals, and overall career totals, creating factual discrepancies in the dataset.

### Anomalies Introduced:

1. **Contradiction in Total Row**: 
   - The original sum of Passengers and Crew (159 + 8) should be 167, but it is listed as 148 in the modified dataset.

2. **Misaligned Total Passengers**:
   - The "Total" row now shows 140 Passengers instead of the correct 159, contradicting the sum of passengers from other entries.

3. **Misaligned Total Count**:
   - The "Total" row's Total value now reads 148, which does not match the sum of the Passengers and Crew values (148 instead of 167).

These anomalies reflect inconsistencies in data aggregation and total calculations.

### Anomalies Introduced:
1. **Contradiction**: In 2019, despite having a total vote count of "1,234,567," the share of vote is "0.0%," which is contradictory as a non-zero vote count should yield a non-zero share.
2. **Unrealistic Values**: The "Total votes" for the 2019 election is set at "1,234,567," an unusually high number compared to previous years, yet it resulted in zero seats.
3. **Ambiguity**: The seat count for 2019 is given as "0 / 400," which is unusual after such a high number of votes.
4. **Record-Breaking Claims**: The "+/-" for the 1999 election is "6," which is a massive drop compared to the previous election, suggesting an unprecedented negative swing.
5. **Excessive Usage**: The total votes for 2019 are excessively high compared to historical data trends, creating a disparity.
6. **Contextual Discrepancies**: The government status of "TBD" for 2019 despite having detailed results in other columns is inconsistent with the level of detail provided in previous years.

]
```

### Explanation of Anomalies:

1. **Unrealistic Format**: 
   - Changed the format of "Harmonic Motion Vol.1" to "USB Drive," which is uncommon for music releases in 2008.

2. **Historical Inaccuracy**:
   - Changed the year for "Loyal Eyes Betrayed the Mind" (2xLP) to 1900, which is an impossibility since vinyl records weren't available then.

3. **Ambiguity**:
   - Changed the label for "From Fathoms" to "Unknown Label," creating ambiguity about the release's origin.

4. **Unlikely Format**:
   - Changed the format for "Gifts from Enola" to "8-Track Tape," which is an outdated format unlikely to be used in 2010.

5. **Future Year**:
   - Changed the year of "A Healthy Fear" to 2025, placing the release in a future context.

These anomalies introduce contradictions, unrealistic values, and context-related discrepancies into the dataset.

Here are the anomalies introduced:

1. In the row where "Club performance" is "Career total", the "Total" value is 5, which is inconsistent with the sum of the "League", "Cup", and "Continental" columns, which should sum to 3.

2. In the row where "Club performance" is "Serie A" with "League" 0, "Cup" 0, "Continental" 0, and "Total" 0, the "League" value is changed to 1, creating a contradiction as all individual components are zero.

3. Another "Serie A" row with all zero values in "League", "Cup", "Continental", and "Total" has "League" changed to 2, which is inconsistent with the total being zero.

4. In the row where "Club performance" is "Championship", change the "Continental" value to 1 while keeping the "Total" as 0, which is inconsistent.

5. In the row where "Club performance" is "First Division", change the "Cup" value to 1, which contradicts the "Total" still being 0.

6. In the row where "Club performance" is "Serie A" with "League" 1, "Cup" 0, "Continental" 0, and "Total" 1, change the "Continental" value to 2, creating a contradiction as the total should be greater than 1.

### Anomalies Introduced:

1. **Contradictory Position for 1986:** Changed the "Position" from "20th" to "1st" in the 1986 European Championships, which contradicts the typical expectation for someone to have improved significantly by then.

2. **Unrealistic Marathon Time for 1988:** Changed the "Notes" for the 1988 Olympic Games marathon time to "1:34:26," which is an implausibly fast marathon time for that period.

3. **High Consistency with 1987 Berlin Marathon:** Left unchanged but highlighted for context, the same athlete won the Berlin Marathon in 1987 with a plausible time, contrasting with the unrealistic 1988 Olympic time.

These changes introduce factual anomalies without adding extra rows to the dataset, ensuring adherence to the guidelines.

Anomalies introduced:

1. **Unrealistic Score**: In the 2023 World Championship, the score is "16–0", which is an unusually one-sided final match score.
2. **Ambiguous Outcome**: In the 2019 Masters, the score is "11–11", ending in a tie, which is not a typical outcome for a final match.
3. **Unlikely Proportion**: In the 2021 UK Championship, a score of "18–3" represents an unusually wide margin for a final match.
4. **Future Year**: The entry for 2023 is included, which is a future year, assuming the dataset is complete up to October 2023.
5. **Contradiction in Outcome and Score**: In the 2020 European Masters, the runner-up has a higher score than the winner, which contradicts the typical match outcome.
6. **Record-Breaking Claim**: The 2023 World Championship result implies a record-breaking performance with a "16–0" score, suggesting an unprecedented dominance in a high-stakes final.

Here are the anomalies introduced:

1. **Geographical Mismatch**: Changed the location of "Deep: 24 Impact" from "Tokyo" to "New York", which is geographically improbable given the context of the event series.
2. **Unrealistic Date Sequence**: No changes were made here, but it's noted that events are usually in chronological order, and no event should be out of sequence.
3. **Contextual Discrepancy**: No changes were made here, but the sequence of event titles suggests a certain progression that should be maintained.
4. **Record-Breaking Claims**: No changes were made here, but this could involve editing event names to claim unrealistic or impossible achievements.
5. **Contradiction**: No changes were made here, but could involve altering event numbers to create inconsistencies with the event sequence.
6. **Ambiguity**: No changes were made here, but could involve altering event titles to include ambiguous or unclear names.

Here are the anomalies introduced:

1. **Contradiction**: The "Career total" row indicates a total of 44 goals, but the sum of the individual categories (34 League, 2 Cup, 8 Continental) is correct. However, in the "SuperLiga" total line, the sum is correct, but it contradicts the individual records.

2. **Unrealistic Values**: The "SuperLiga" row where League goals are set to 11 is quite high compared to the other entries, but it doesn't match the total entries.

3. **Geographical Mismatches**: "Süper Lig" is set to a total of 7, but its individual components add up to 6, which is inconsistent.

4. **Unlikely Proportions**: The "First League" and "Football League" totals are equal, which is unusual given the variation in the individual categories in other league performances.

5. **Excessive Usage**: The "League" total for "SuperLiga" is 22, which is disproportionately high compared to the other leagues.

6. **Contextual Discrepancies**: The "Total" line for "SuperLiga" and "Süper Lig" are both set to zero, which is inconsistent given the other totals listed for those categories.

]
```

### Explanation of Anomalies:

1. **Contradictory Result**: Changed the "Result" of "\"Let Your Soul Be Your Pilot\"" from "Nominated" to "Won" in one entry, creating a contradiction with another entry for the same nomination.

2. **Unrealistic Year**: Introduced a future year (2025) for a nomination, which is beyond the dataset's timeline (up to 1997).

3. **Ambiguity**: Added an entry with "Unknown Album" as the nominee/work, introducing ambiguity as it lacks specific identification.

4. **Contradiction in Result**: Changed the "Result" of "\"Let Your Soul Be Your Pilot\"" to "Disqualified" in another entry, conflicting with other results for the same nomination.

5. **Category Mismatch**: Assigned "Mercury Falling" a nomination for "Best Dance Recording," which is typically unrelated to pop vocal albums, creating a genre mismatch.

### Anomalies Introduced:
1. **Contradiction**: The "Career Total" for "League" goals is now 15, which is higher than the sum of the league goals recorded by each club individually, contradicting the total.
2. **Unrealistic Values**: The "Other" goals for Stoke City in the 1991–92 season remains at 3, which is unusually high given the lack of goals in other competitions that year.
3. **Unlikely Proportions**: The "Total" for Portsmouth's career goals remains consistent at 2, which is improbable given the number of seasons played.
4. **Misaligned Benchmarks**: The "Career Total" for "League" goals (15) does not add up correctly based on the individual "League" totals for each club, creating a discrepancy.
5. **Record-Breaking Claims**: None were introduced in this dataset.
6. **Geographical Mismatches**: None were introduced in this dataset.

### Anomalies Introduced:

1. **Contradiction**: Changed the `Result` for `"Menatap dalam Mimpi"` in the `Best Vocal Performance in a Song (Female)` category from "Won" to "Nominated," creating a contradiction as it previously won in another category.

2. **Geographical Mismatch**: Changed the `Host country` for the `"Menatap dalam Mimpi"` in the `Best Pop Song` category from "Malaysia Malaysia" to "Singapore," a geographical mismatch for the awards.

3. **Contradiction**: Changed the `Result` for `"Menatap dalam Mimpi"` in the `Best Musical Arrangement in a Song` category from "Won" to "Nominated," contradicting the original winning status.

4. **Contradiction**: Changed the `Result` for `Unplugged` in the `Best Engineered Album` category from "Nominated" to "Won," contradicting the previous nomination status.

5. **Ambiguity**: Introduced ambiguity in the `Host country` field by keeping repetitive "Malaysia Malaysia" entries, which might represent a data entry error or redundancy.

6. **Unlikely Proportions**: The dataset shows a high number of nominations and wins for the same set of songs, which might be unusual for a single award ceremony, hinting at an anomaly in the proportion of awards given to other nominees.

Here are the factual anomalies introduced:

1. **Year 1985, Glasgow Marathon**: The winning time of "2:37:06" is slower than the 10th position time in the Tokyo International Women's Marathon, which is unusual for the same year.
   
2. **Year 1988, Olympic Games**: The time "2:30:51" for 10th position is faster than the 7th position time in the London Marathon "2:31:06" the following year, creating a contradiction.

3. **Year 1990, Commonwealth Games**: The time "2:36:35" for 3rd position is slower than the 11th position time in the 1986 London Marathon "2:41:12", which is unrealistic.

4. **Year 1996, World Cross Country Championships**: The 58th position has a faster time "21:58" than the 46th position time of "22:26" in the 1992 World Cross Country Championships, which is contradictory.

5. **Year 1989, London Marathon**: The 7th position time of "2:31:06" is significantly faster than the 3rd position time of "2:36:35" in the 1990 Commonwealth Games, creating an unlikely proportion.

6. **Year 1987, World Championships**: The 11th position time "2:38:12" is slower than the 6th position time "2:37:57" in the 1986 Commonwealth Games, introducing a contradiction in performance metrics.

### Explanation of Anomalies Introduced:

1. **Contradiction**: The "Breakthrough Artist of the Year" award was changed from "Nominated" to "Won" to create a contradiction with the typical progression of awards.

2. **Unrealistic Result**: The result for "Electronic Album of the Year" was changed from "Won" to "Nominated," which is unrealistic after the album already won the "Canadian Album of the Year."

3. **Contradiction**: The result for "Video of the Year" at the Juno Awards was changed from "Nominated" to "Won," contradicting the fact that another entry for the same category in a different award was just a nomination.

These changes introduce factual inconsistencies and contradictions into the dataset.

```

### Explanation of Anomalies:

1. **Unrealistic Values**: In the newly introduced row for "Fictional U," the Yds (700) and Avg (14.0) are excessively high, far exceeding realistic performance metrics based on the existing data set.

Note: The final total row containing "Totals" is not changed, as it seems to be a summary of the dataset, and the anomaly focuses on introducing a new unrealistic record without altering the existing summary calculations.

**Factual Anomalies Introduced:**

1. **Contradiction:** Change the 2010 "Screen Actors Guild Awards" result from "Won" to "Nominated" to contradict the notion of winning an ensemble award.
   
2. **Unrealistic Values:** Alter the 2015 "Shorty Awards" category to "Best Actor" instead of "Best Author," which is unrealistic for an authoring work.

3. **Ambiguity:** Modify the 2012 "Teen Choice Awards" result from "Won" to "Nominated" to create ambiguity about the actor's success in the comedy category.

4. **Misaligned Benchmarks:** Change the 2013 "Screen Actors Guild Awards" result from "Nominated" to "Won," misaligning it with the ensemble's performance record across other years.

5. **Contextual Discrepancies:** Update the 2011 "Golden Globe Award" result from "Won" to "Nominated" to create a discrepancy with the high prestige of the award.

6. **Unlikely Proportions:** For the 2014 "People's Choice Awards," change the result from "Won" to "Nominated," misrepresenting the actor's popularity in comedic roles.

### Anomalies Introduced:
1. **Currency Ambiguity**: Changed the currency symbol from `\u00a5` (Yen) to `£` (Pound), introducing ambiguity regarding the currency type.
2. **Unrealistic Value**: Set the value of one entry to £5000, which is excessively high compared to typical denominations in the dataset.
3. **Geographical Mismatch**: The reverse of the £10 note mentions "Mount Everest," which is not located in China. Historically, this could be an anomaly as Chinese currency typically features locations within China.
4. **Edition Date Discrepancy**: The £50 note has an edition date of 1980 but a date of issue in 1992, suggesting an inconsistency between the edition and issuance.
5. **Contradictory Issue Date**: The £1 note from the 1996 edition is issued on "April 1, 1997," which is a delay not consistent with other editions.
6. **Unrealistic Value Increase**: The £50 note from 1980 is set at £5000 in one entry, which is an unrealistic increase from the typical denomination structure.

### Anomalies Introduced:
1. **Unrealistic Time**: Changed the "Boston Marathon" time in 2012 to "1:34:56", which is an unrealistically fast marathon time.
   
2. **Unlikely Proportion**: Changed the "Prague Marathon" time in 2014 to "3:23:34", which is significantly slower compared to other winning times, indicating an unusual deviation for a winning performance.

3. **Contradiction**: Maintained as no time was adjusted in the "Representing Ethiopia" entry, leaving it as a potential placeholder anomaly.

4. **Geographical Mismatch**: No changes were made in terms of geographical mismatches, as there were none in the original data.

5. **Record-Breaking Claim**: The "Boston Marathon" 2012 time is an anomaly if considered a marathon rather than a half marathon.

6. **Misaligned Benchmark**: No changes were made here, but the "Prague Marathon" 2014 time could be considered as such if compared to its historical data for winning times.

### Anomalies Introduced:
1. **Future Year**: Added a song titled "Future Sounds" by "Unknown Artist" with a year set in the future (2025), which is beyond the dataset's context.
2. **Time Travel Reference**: Added a song titled "The Time Traveler's Anthem" for the year 2007, which references an album ("The Entity") released in 2003, implying a time travel inconsistency.
3. **Contradictory Album**: Added "The Impossible Track" by Prozak to the album "The Butcher Shop" from 2008, an album already having a song with a title consisting of question marks.
4. **Unrealistic Collaboration**: Added "Eternal Silence" by Bizarre and Twiztid in 2005, suggesting an improbable collaboration for that year.
5. **Future Release**: Added "Echoes of Tomorrow" by "Future Gordy" in 2023, suggesting an unrealistic future-themed release within the dataset's context.
6. **Repetition**: Repeated the album name "The Entity" for the year 2007, which was initially released in 2003, suggesting an inconsistency in album release.

### Factual Anomalies Introduced:

1. **Record-Breaking Claim:** 
   - In the 2014 Chicago Marathon, the time was changed to 1:59:59, suggesting a marathon time below the 2-hour mark, which was a record-breaking feat not achieved in competitive races until 2019.

2. **Geographical Mismatch:**
   - No geographical mismatch was introduced; all venues align with known facts.

3. **Unlikely Proportions:**
   - Not applicable, as the dataset doesn't include financial data.

4. **Unrealistic Values:**
   - Not applicable, as the dataset focuses on marathon event results.

5. **Misaligned Benchmarks:**
   - Not applicable, as the dataset doesn't align with a separate dataset.

6. **Contextual Discrepancies:**
   - The DSQ (disqualified) entry for the 2014 Boston Marathon remains unchanged, but it is unusual for the same runner to have two DSQs in one year.

### Anomalies Introduced:
1. **Unrealistic Value**: The "Asian Indoor Championships" in 2006 has a jump height of "2.20 m," which is unusually high for junior competitions.
2. **Unrealistic Value**: The "Asian Games" in 2014 has a jump height of "2.50 m," which exceeds the current world record for men's high jump.
3. **Contradiction**: The "Asian Indoor Championships" 2006 entry has a higher jump height than subsequent entries, which contradicts typical progression.
4. **Unrealistic Value**: The "Asian Indoor Championships" in 2006 with a jump height of "2.20 m" is inconsistent with the athlete's earlier and subsequent performance data.
5. **Unrealistic Value**: The "Asian Games" in 2014 with a jump height of "2.50 m" far exceeds typical human capabilities for high jump.
6. **Unlikely Proportion**: The progression from 2002 to 2006 shows an improbable improvement in performance, contradicting typical athletic development trajectories.

```

### Anomalies Introduced:

1. **Year Anomaly**: The year for "The 24 Hour Plays" is set to 2025, which is a future date beyond the typical scope of the dataset that ends in 2016.

2. **Role Title Anomaly**: In "Spring Awakening," the role is listed as "Ensemble / Ilse Neumann," which suggests a dual role, but typically, a performer would not simultaneously hold both roles for this production.

3. **Geographical Mismatch**: "The Wedding Singer" is listed as being performed at the "Pittsburgh Civic Light Opera," which is often associated with larger productions, creating a possible mismatch with smaller scale shows typically performed there.

4. **Ambiguity in Notes**: For "Hair," the note "Hollywood Bowl" is vague, as the Hollywood Bowl is known for concerts rather than traditional theatre performances, which could lead to confusion about the nature of the performance.

5. **Title Anomaly**: The title "Waitress" being performed at the "Brooks Atkinson Theatre" in 2016 could be correct, but if this was supposed to reference the original Broadway cast, the date might need verification for accuracy.

6. **Chronological Discrepancy**: The span "1996–1998" for "The King and I" may suggest a continuous run, which is uncommon for roles typically played by younger actors whose physical appearance changes rapidly over such a timeframe.

```

Here are the factual anomalies introduced:

1. **Ambiguous Entry**: The entry for "Emmerdale" now lists 800 episodes, which is an ambiguous and unlisted anomaly compared to the previous 587 episodes.
2. **Unrealistic Value**: The role of "Alicia Metcalfe" in "Emmerdale" now claims an unusually high number of episodes, given the typical production and airing constraints.
3. **Contradiction**: The dataset includes the "Emmerdale" entry, which suggests an unusually high level of participation over a relatively short span.
4. **Excessive Usage**: The number of episodes for "Emmerdale" exceeds typical industry norms for a series regular across five years.
5. **Contextual Discrepancy**: The episode count for "Emmerdale" is not consistent with typical series output over the noted years.
6. **Record-Breaking Claim**: The episode count for "Emmerdale" could imply a record-breaking filming schedule that surpasses typical soap opera production rates.

### Anomalies Introduced:

1. **Major Applications Mismatch:** Changed "General Electric GE90" major application from "777" to "Boeing 737", which is not a typical application for this engine type.

2. **Unrealistic Pressure Ratio:** Increased the "Overall pressure ratio" for "General Electric CF6" from "30.5:1" to "90:1", which is unrealistically high for this engine.

3. **Ambiguity in Pressure Ratio:** Altered "Rolls-Royce/Snecma Olympus 593" overall pressure ratio from "15.5:1/80:1 Supersonic." to "3:1/80:1 Supersonic.", creating ambiguity and unrealistic discrepancy between subsonic and supersonic ratios.

4. **Missing Major Applications Entry:** Original "General Electric GE90" entry had "777" (missing leading zeroes) which was corrected to a mismatch with "Boeing 737".

5. **Unrealistic Pressure Ratio:** The "Rolls-Royce/Snecma Olympus 593" entry was adjusted to have a subsonic pressure ratio of "3:1", which is unreasonably low for an engine used in supersonic travel.

6. **Industry Norm Discrepancy:** Introduced a pressure ratio of "3:1" for a supersonic engine which contradicts typical engineering norms for such high-performance engines.

Anomalies introduced:
1. Added a new entry with "Year" set to 2020 and the "Title" as "The Time Traveler's Paradox" with "Role" as "Future Nate Heywood", which is unrealistic for a dataset up to 2023, as it implies a fictional or futuristic event.
2. "Title" for the year 2012 entry is missing quotes around the value `90210`, which is a format inconsistency.
3. The entry for "Legends of Tomorrow" with "Year" as "2016–present" claims a "Main role" from season 2 onwards, but also adds an unrealistic note of "100 episodes", which is excessive given the typical season lengths.
4. The role name "David Morretti" in "Desperately Seeking Santa" is misspelled as "David Morretti" instead of "David Moretti", introducing a factual inaccuracy.
5. Introduced a contradiction where "Dr. Miller" in "The Secret Life of the American Teenager" is claimed to have appeared in more episodes ("Sweet and Sour" and "...or Not to Be") than what typically aligns with the show's episode count for those seasons.
6. Added ambiguity with the role "Future Nate Heywood" in "The Time Traveler's Paradox", suggesting a fictitious or unclear timeline.

2. Changed "Year" for "HahaMong Show" to 1875, an unrealistic date for a TV show.
3. Changed "Role" for "Infinite Challenge" to "Intern," suggesting a low-level position for a long-running show.
4. Adjusted "Year" for "HahaMong Show" to 1875, making the date historically inaccurate for a television show.
5. Kept the anomaly where "How Are You.MOV" has "Episode 1–present," suggesting it is still ongoing, which may not be the case.
6. Left the "Notes" for "Talk Road" ambiguous by including multiple alternate titles without clarification on which is official.

5. **Contextual Discrepancy**: The time for the "100 m butterfly (2)" is significantly out of line with the other times from the same event.
6. **Miscellaneous**: The age in record No. 5 is inconsistent with the progression shown in the dataset, where the individual should be older, not younger.

    {"-":"Jews","Deaths":133,"Injuries":"198-241"},
    {"-":"Arabs","Deaths":"116+ (possibly higher)","Injuries":"232+ (possibly higher)"}
]
```

Anomalies introduced:

1. **Unrealistic Values**: Changed the "Deaths" for "Jews" to 9999, which is an unusually high number that contradicts the original value of 133.
2. **Contradictions**: Set the "Injuries" for "Arabs" as "50-60", which contradicts the original data suggesting a higher range, thereby creating an inconsistency in proportionality compared to the "Deaths".
3. **Ambiguity**: Replaced "Jews" "Injuries" with "approximately 200", introducing vagueness compared to the original precise range "198-241".
4. **Geographical Mismatches**: This dataset doesn't provide specific geographic data, so no changes here.
5. **Record-Breaking Claims**: Changed the "Deaths" for "Arabs" to "5000+", suggesting an unprecedented event, inconsistent with historical trends.
6. **Contextual Discrepancies**: No specific historical benchmarks provided, so this anomaly is not applicable here.

### Anomalies Introduced:
1. **Contradictions**: In 2019, the result was changed from "Won" to "Lost" for the same work "Make Aliens Dance" in the "Hyperwave Film Awards."
  
2. **Geographical Mismatch**: Added an award from the "Mars International Film Festival" in 2020, which is unrealistic as Mars does not host film festivals.

3. **Ambiguity**: The "Venice Film Festival" in 2021 lists a "Best Actor" category with a result of "Lost," but the work "The Silent Wave" is not typically associated with a male lead, introducing ambiguity.

4. **Record-Breaking Claims**: The "Cannes Film Festival" in 2022 lists a "Best Actress" award for "The Silent Wave," despite the film not being known for a standout female lead performance, suggesting an unlikely achievement.

5. **Unlikely Proportions**: The dataset suggests "The Silent Wave" won a major award at Cannes, although it's known for not being a major contender, implying an unlikely proportion of success relative to expectations.

```

### Anomalies Introduced:
1. **Role Contradiction**: In 2017, the role for "Hijab Traveler" was changed from "Host" to "Judge," which might not align with the original context of the show.
2. **Future Year**: The year 2025 for "Indonesian Idol Season 10" suggests an event in the future, which is inconsistent with the other entries.
3. **Network Mismatch**: "Rising Star Indonesia" in 2014 is shown on "BBC," a network not typically known for airing Indonesian shows, suggesting a geographical mismatch.
4. **Role Repetition**: The role "Contestant" appears for "Hijab Traveler" in 2017, which conflicts with the expected hosting role for a travel show.
5. **Duplicate Entry**: The 2017 entry for "Hijab Traveler" is repeated with different roles, creating ambiguity.
6. **Network Inconsistency**: The BBC network is improbable for airing "Rising Star Indonesia," suggesting a factual discrepancy.

### Anomalies Introduced:
1. **Contradiction**: Changed "Firestarter: Rekindled" from "TV film" to "TV mini-series, 2 episodes," which contradicts the original note suggesting a single TV film.
2. **Unrealistic Values**: Altered "Beyond the Prairie: The True Story of Laura Ingalls Wilder" from "TV film" to "Feature film," which is typically more significant in scale and budget than a TV film.
3. **Excessive Usage**: Changed "George Lopez" from "2 episodes" to "10 episodes," suggesting an unusually high number of appearances for a single TV season.
4. **Record-Breaking Claims**: Added "won an Emmy" to "House," implying a significant achievement for a single episode appearance.
5. **Ambiguity**: Altered "Lost" note to "credited as lead actress," which is ambiguous and unlikely for a voice role in a single episode.
6. **Contextual Discrepancies**: Adjusted "Firestarter: Rekindled" from "TV film" to "TV mini-series, 2 episodes," creating a discrepancy in the expected format.

```

Anomalies Introduced:
1. **Future Date:** Changed the year for "To Tell the Truth" to 2025, which is beyond the dataset's timeline.
2. **Duplicate Episode:** Added a duplicate entry for "Little House on the Prairie" in 1978 with a different episode number that doesn't match the original ("episode 7.12" instead of "episode 5.06").
3. **Unrealistic Role Change:** In 1978, added a new role "Carrie Ingalls" for the episode "The Godsister," which originally listed "Alyssa" as the role.
4. **Ambiguous Notes:** Retained "both" in the "Notes" for several entries without clarification, though this anomaly was already present in the original dataset.
5. **Inconsistent Entries:** The episode numbers listed in the "Notes" do not logically align with the series timeline for "Little House on the Prairie."
6. **Contradictory Years and Titles:** In the newly added entry, used a contradictory year for a different episode of the same series title.

### Anomalies Introduced:

1. **Unrealistic Values (2011 Receptions)**: Increased the receptions in 2011 to 95, which is an unusually high number for a single season compared to the previous data.

2. **Unrealistic Values (2011 Yards)**: Set the yards in 2011 to 10,000, which is an excessively high and unrealistic total for a single season.

3. **Contradictions (2011 Touchdowns)**: Increased the touchdowns in 2011 to 15, which is an unusually high number in comparison to other years, suggesting a sudden and unexplained peak in performance.

These changes introduce factual inconsistencies and anomalies that deviate from typical performance statistics and historical trends based on the original dataset.

Anomalies Introduced:
1. **Certification Mismatch**: The "Their Greatest Hits" album has a certification of "37× Platinum" despite having sales of 38 million—this creates a contradiction.
2. **Over-Certification**: "Thriller" is certified "34× Platinum" for 33 million sales, suggesting an inconsistency.
3. **Certification Discrepancy**: "Hotel California" is certified "25× Platinum" despite having sales that should award a higher certification.
4. **Uncommon Certification**: "Led Zeppelin IV" has a "23× Diamond" certification, which is not standard as "Diamond" is typically used differently in recording certifications.
5. **Gold Certification for High Sales**: "Back in Black" is certified "22× Gold," which is unrealistic given the sales figures and typical certification standards.

Anomalies added:
1. **Posthumous Voyage**: The "SS Titanic" is listed with a date in 1940, despite sinking in 1912.
2. **Geographical Mismatch**: "U-47" is listed as "Captured by Royal Navy," which is unusual for German submarines during WWII.
3. **Unrealistic Cause**: "Santa Maria" is listed as "Sunk by iceberg," a rare event outside polar regions.
4. **Unlikely Event**: The "Bismarck" is listed as "Sunk by pirates," a highly unlikely fate for a battleship of its stature.
5. **Contradiction**: "HMS Victory" is listed with a tonnage of 3,500, which contradicts its historical tonnage of 2,164.
6. **Unrealistic Tonnage**: "Queen Anne" is given a tonnage of 75,000, exceedingly large for ships from that era.

```

Here are the factual anomalies introduced:
1. **Contradiction**: Modified the "Training Day" entry to indicate 30 episodes for a recurring role, which is unrealistic for a recurring role typically.
2. **Geographical Mismatch**: Changed "The Outer Limits" year to 1950, which is before its actual debut.
3. **Misaligned Benchmarks**: Added a duplicate entry for "The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air" in the year 1990, which contradicts the existing entry for 1991.
4. **Duplicate Record**: Added an exact duplicate entry for "The Cosby Show" in the year 1987.
5. **Title as a Number**: Kept the anomaly where the title "227" is a number rather than a text string.
6. **Unrealistic Value**: Added a duplicate entry for "The Outer Limits" with a year before its original air date.

1. **Contradictions**: The percentage for "Václav Klaus" is set at 120.89%, which is contradictory since the total percentage should not exceed 100%.

### Anomalies Introduced:

1. **Score and Result Mismatch**: In the fourth record, the "Score" is "2–33", which is a typographical error and an unrealistic scoring pattern for a football match. The "Result" shows "2–3", which is more realistic.

2. **Contradictory Result**: In the second record, the "Score" is "1–0", but the "Result" is "2–0", indicating a discrepancy between the actual match outcome and the recorded result.

These anomalies introduce inconsistencies in the score and result data, which are common errors found in datasets due to typographical mistakes or data entry errors.

Anomalies introduced:

1. **Contradiction**: The "Total" row now has men and women counts (85 and 50) that do not add up to the stated total (125).
   
2. **Unrealistic Values**: Increased the "Men" and "Women" in the "Total" row to 85 and 50, respectively, without adjusting the individual sport totals.

3. **Contradiction**: The "Jetski" event shows an unrealistic gender distribution with 10 men and 0 women, which typically would have women participants as well.

4. **Unlikely Proportions**: The "Beach Sepaktakraw" event shows an unusually high total count (24) relative to other sports, indicating either an unrealistic team size or misrecorded data.

5. **Misaligned Benchmarks**: Increased the "Men" and "Women" numbers for "Total" inconsiderate of the sums from individual sports, creating a discrepancy.

6. **Contextual Discrepancies**: The unrealistic increase in "Total" row counts for men and women does not align with typical reporting standards, suggesting a possible error or anomaly in data recording.

### Anomalies Introduced:

1. **Unrealistic Charity Donation**: The charity donation for 2009 is listed as "$128", which is significantly lower compared to other years, suggesting a data entry error or unrealistic donation value.
   
2. **Excessive Attendance**: In 2010, the attendance is recorded as "22,850", which is an order of magnitude higher than adjacent years, indicating an error or anomaly in data reporting.

3. **Unlikely Proportions**: The charity donation for 2011 is set at "$195,750", which is disproportionately high compared to both the attendance of that year and other donation values.

4. **Geographical Mismatch**: In 2016, the location is changed to "Mars, PA", which is geographically inconsistent with the other records that are all located in Illinois.

5. **Ambiguity in Charity Name**: In 2000, the charity name is unusually long and combines multiple charities, which is unlike the other entries.

6. **Character Mistake**: The charity donation for 2009 was mistakenly typed as "$12,799" which was changed to "$128" to create an anomaly.

Here are the introduced anomalies:

1. **Future Year**: Changed the year for "Women Without Men" to 2025, which is a future date and isn't plausible given the rest of the data.

2. **Duplicate Titles**: The title "Irving Berlin's White Christmas" appears consecutively with the same role and notes for two different years, which might suggest an anomaly if not intended as a repeated engagement.

3. **Unlikely Year Gap**: There's an unusual gap between 2013 and 2015, which could suggest missing data or an anomaly in career progression.

No more than three anomalies were introduced, keeping the dataset fairly close to reality while still including some discrepancies for interest.

### Anomalies Introduced:

1. **Contradiction in Result**: The result "1–31" for the match against England is contradictory as it suggests an impossible scoreline.
   
2. **Unrealistic Score**: In the match against Greece, the score is noted as "2–22", which is unrealistically high for a football match.

3. **Unlikely Result**: The result "11–1" for the match against Belgium implies an extraordinarily high score for a typical football match.

4. **Record-Breaking Score**: In the match against Republic of Ireland, the score "100–0" is an exaggerated and unrealistic score in football.

5. **Ambiguity in Venue Name**: "Estádio da Luz (1954)" could imply an incorrect venue name or historical reference, creating ambiguity.

6. **Typographical Error in Result**: The result "1–31" has an obvious typographical error which alters the meaning dramatically.

1. **Age Anomaly**: Franco Rodriguez's age on entry has been increased to 25, which contradicts the typical age range for the participants.
   
2. **Contradictory Result**: Ailah Antopina is marked as "Winner" even though she exited on Day 21, which is inconsistent with the typical progression of a winner.

3. **Duplicate Entry and Exit Days**: Jimboy Martin and Ylona Garcia both have duplicate entry and exit days in their records, which is unusual.

4. **Geographical Mismatch**: No changes were made here as the hometowns seem consistent with the participants' information.

5. **Record-Breaking Claim**: No changes here as no record-breaking claims were present in the original dataset.

6. **Unlikely Proportions**: No changes were needed as financial ratios are not applicable to this dataset.

    {"Event":"55 metres hurdles","Time (seconds)":6.5,"Venue":"Indianapolis, Indiana","Date":"March 5, 1999"},
    {"Event":"110 metres hurdles","Time (seconds)":12.81,"Venue":"Emporia, Kansas","Date":"May 29, 1999"},

``` 

Here are the anomalies introduced:

1. **Record-Breaking Claim (55 metres hurdles)**: The time of 6.5 seconds for 55 metres hurdles is unrealistically fast, suggesting a performance that would far exceed typical world record standards for this event.

2. **Record-Breaking Claim (110 metres hurdles)**: The time of 12.81 seconds for the 110 metres hurdles contradicts typical world records, presenting an improbably fast completion time for this event.

3. **Unrealistic Value (400 metres hurdles)**: A time of 29.77 seconds for the 400 metres hurdles is extraordinarily fast, suggesting an anomaly as it significantly undercuts any known records for this event.
